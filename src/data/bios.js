        alejandro toledo acierto is an artist, musician, and curator whose
        projects are informed by legacies of colonialism found within human

          in Juneau. She holds an MFA in creative writing, an MA in critical
          craft studies, and teaches the craft of repair as an act of
          prolonging, care, and accompaniment of vulnerable objects in
          transition. A first memory of repair is from age five. When she
          snipped a hole in an undershirt so she wouldn’t have to wear it
          anymore, her Swedish mother mended it by hand and made her wear it
          anyway—a first experiment with autonomy and the power of a cut,
          swiftly overshadowed by the authority of the mend. She is raising
          children (and repairing their clothing) on Dena’ina Homeland,
          currently referred to as Anchorage, Alaska.

          I was 18 when I decided to turn my gold lamé prom dress into pants. My
          mom is a phenomenal seamstress; she created almost all her own clothes
          (including a moment in the 80s when she fell hard for track suits and
          made one for every day of the week). She tried to teach me many times,
          but there always seemed to be something more interesting to do. I did
          not love sitting still. I did, however, love altering clothes—with
          safety pins, knots, paint, and duct tape.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          But these pants needed to be done right, so I asked my mom for help.
          She sat me down, showed me how to make a pattern, how to thread the
          sewing machine, how to sew the garment inside out.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          The pants were a disaster in too many ways to list. I was devastated.
          How could so much work result in such a shitty-looking thing?
        </p>

        <p>
          I did not learn to sew that weekend, but I did learn that my mom is a
          badass and that making things requires more than the desire to do so;
          it requires the ability to keep making through disappointment and
          heartbreak.

          Kevin McNamee-Tweed’s practice investigates the mechanics of
          meaning-making and storytelling, and embraces broad material
          exploration to create images and objects that narrate, measure, or
          express nuances of human experience and material reality. While much
          of his work may be naturally situated within the context of
          image-making, painting, and drawing, McNamee-Tweed works extensively
          with clay. Incorporating native clays and regional traditions, the
          artist relies on time-honored as well as idiosyncratic uses of clay
          and glaze materials. He makes intimate, utilitarian objects and many
          things which situate themselves between categories, such as
          function-resistant objects, ceramic books, and wall-hanging pictorial
          ceramics, which have become his primary focus in recent years.
        </p>

        <p>
          McNamee-Tweed’s pictorial ceramics, or “ceramic paintings,” employ
          meticulous techniques, controlled processes, and tempered
          experimentation to achieve image-based corporeality featuring
          exaggerated surfaces, textures, and visual effects. Relating
          intimately to the hand and the eye, these book-sized objects carry a
          strong element of storytelling. Often with pathos and playfulness, his
          narratives include personal, mundane, or grandiose ruminations, while
          his stylistic tendencies and formal sensibilities span references from
          the art-historical to the commonplace. Frequently, his imagery
          reflects on traditions of image- and object-making, with particular
          emphasis on quotidian visual culture, the history of painting, and the
          immense lineage of practical application and artistic expression with
          ceramics.

          Mellanee Goodman is a creative supporter, arts administrator, and
          scholar. An enthusiast of sorts, Mellanee’s interests lie at the
          intersection of the multiplicity of objects, material culture, and
          design. During her graduate work for Warren Wilson College’s MA in
          Critical Craft Studies program, Mellanee researched the lives and
          experiences of Black craftswomen who lived between 1850 and 1910 in
          the upper South. This was done through a contextualization of enslaved
          labor as craft labor and an analysis of how, as free women, Black
          women did not abandon their crafts; rather, they continued to
          exemplify their artistry. Mellanee mapped multigenerational
          changes—from craftswomen being enslaved to craftswomen being free
          women entering into institutionalized education. For Mellanee, her
          graduate work solidified her admiration for craft as it unveiled a
          hereditary connection—craft being deeply embedded in African American
          history. She continues to pursue this research amongst other fields of
          study within contemporary craft. Outside of her professional work
          Mellanee is an avid lover of classic cinema who has a deep devotion to
          all things vintage.

          Born the daughter of a painter and an organic dairy farmer, my
          childhood was divided between physical labor, play, and creating art.
          For nearly 20 years, I have worked as a ceramic artist and designer to
          merge the physicality and meaning of ceramic forms with a painterly
          surface. Best known for creating wall installations composed of my
          hand-painted ceramic plates, I have evolved my studio practice to
          include a broad catalog of dimensional ceramic forms to create dynamic
          sculptural paintings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Informed by inherited objects and legacy, my ceramic installations
          transform and deconstruct traditional patterns and motifs sourced from
          the history of decorative arts and painting. I digitally alter
          historic imagery through shifts in color, scale, and composition.
          Creating access to art through our universal familiarity with the
          domestic plate, I create a perceptual shift that occurs when audiences
          view plates on the wall as one would view a painting. I work to create
          a visual gateway for the viewer to rethink preconceptions around
          hierarchies of art, abstraction, formality, history, and class.

          My work has been exhibited internationally with large-scale permanent
          installations in multiple museums. Commissioned in 2014 by the High

          <em>Physic Garden</em>, is a three-story tall site-specific work meant

          commission to date at the Newark Museum of Art, in Newark, New Jersey.
          Additional installations are on view at the Carnegie Museum of Art,

          Rena Tom is a perpetual outsider and introvert, which is to say she is
          a Gen X baby. She has always been interested in craft, making, and the
          spaces where making happens. Her curiosity about relationships between
          social interaction and physical environments has led to the creation
          of multihyphenate businesses like retail store-art galleries and
          coworking-event spaces. She has a weird fascination with discomfort
          and conducts craft-based research into uncertainty and absence as a
          positive creative force that draws upon insights gleaned from years of
          community-building and cultural production. Current interests include
          prison craft, archives, the mundane and everyday, thought experiments,
          Bay Area artist subcultures, and optical illusions. Somehow, it all
          comes together through writing, site-specific immersive participatory
          art, and experimental publishing, covering topics like stick-and-poke
          tattoos, underground utility marks, and roadside memorials. She sews,
          dyes, and knits poorly but with great enthusiasm in Berkeley,
          California.

          Tina Wiltsie (she/her) is a craft researcher, metalsmith, and tea
          enthusiast. A Michigan girl at heart, Tina currently lives in
          Ypsilanti, a mere hour's drive from her hometown, but likes to remind
          people that she took the long way around, having lived in Stamford,
          Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Traverse City, Michigan; and
          Lawrence, Kansas, in the years between. She has always pursued an
          interdisciplinary academic path, earning her BFA in
          metals/jewelry/CAD-CAM and minors in Japanese, Spanish, and art
          history from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, so it is no
          surprise that she found herself in the MACR program. Besides the
          pieces in this publication, Tina’s work over the past two years has
          included writing on the global movements of craft objects, “craft
          diplomacy” in postwar Japan-US relations, the aesthetics of tea on
          social media, and sensory ethnographies of using a jeweler’s torch.
          Tina is captivated by the unpredictable and non-linear journey of the
          research process, frustrating though it may be at times, and can’t
          think of a single project during her time in the MACR program that
          ended up how she thought it would (though most of them ended just
          where they needed to be).
