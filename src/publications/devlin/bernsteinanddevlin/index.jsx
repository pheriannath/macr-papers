        In this, another conversational segment about translations between words
        and stuff, editor Miriam’s friends Blake and Trieste express sureness
        that physical metaphors can anchor translations. That communication of
        physicality, with language, poses, and drawings (as in manga,) can
        create a connection between bodily spaces.

        <span className="speaker">Blake Bernstein:</span> For the connecting
        metaphor, we use an imagined bodily procedure. Such as: you're hugging a
        barrel full of water to your chest. That circle shape is important for a
        number of structural reasons, and situations. Then, everything we do is
        in the barrel, but the idea of the barrel is more flexible than an
        actual barrel, allowing for more-advanced movements. Instead of being
        shaped like this *shows arms hugging a round barrel*, for example, it
        might stretch to be shaped like this *shows arms holding hugging a
        stretched-out-of-round barrel*. This is still the barrel. Because I
        still have that curvature, I'm still hugging tight, and it’s still full
        of water. We are sloshing.

          [editor’s note: Blake is reading from the book which he has selected
          as having been the most successful, in his martial arts experience, in
          teaching him to move without seeing someone else do the movements. The
          book is The Hustler: Sword Play and the Art of Tactical) by Maija
          Soderholm]
        </em>

      <p>
        Maija says: “You have to understand: the barrel can grow or shrink, it
        can flatten or expand.” They do understand that this doesn't make sense.
        This is in the same vein as in Qui Gong, where we have the cue of
        reaching under the couch, once you have that feeling recognized, you can
        then know that we're on the same level in our bodies. I think those
        simplistic metaphors or examples can draw you into that somatic space.
        And once you've done so, it becomes much easier to communicate from that
        as a jumping-off point. That was a huge takeaway for me, in reading
        about martial arts. Sometimes pictures don't cut it, books don't cut it,
        even seeing it might not cut it. But if you have one nugget of
        information that is anchored to something that I can understand with my
        body then the picture can be telling you so much more. Because you've
        made this, like, a singular base. We're starting on the same spot on the
        map now.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        So now you can start giving me coordinates, and you can check with each
        other. A metaphor is a testable, shared space, right? And if we're
        talking about if you're like, I'm in here, and I look this way, does it
        look like that to you? And you're like, No, that's a little off. And
        then it corrects the image. And the image of the barrel is understood to
        be flexible, as opposed to what in real life wouldn't be flexible. And
        exactly we played with that, that does make sense. It's like painting
        you can imagine reality, and then you can twist it. And you can still
        envision that using like the same physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the Manga I have read communicate movement with words and
        pictures. And some of them <em>show</em> movement, but don’t communicate
        it to me. In an image of two characters engaged in a fistfight: certain
        artists create the art in such a way where I can look at it and sort of
        immediately picture the whole fight in my head, every step of every
        posture, the states of vision, interior vision, whereas in others:
        there's cool art, but the most beautiful art is not necessarily good at
        communicating, although the poses are excellent. But the poses don't
        make sense as a physical narrative. Sometimes they makes sense as an
        emotional narrative, but it might lack that sense of physicality.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In my absolute favorite Kengan Ashura the author, editor and artist, get
        together in a room. Then the author and the editor act out the fights
        according to the author's vision, because he has trained in a few of
        these things. Then the artists sketches the postures as they flow
        between them, allowing for the finished product to make physical sense
        in a way that almost no other one does. I think that this reads better,
        because the exact movements really exist [in that room, in those bodies,
        and in the artist’s vision]. If you instead just try to, if you're
        starting from a place of wanting the beautiful poses, and movement is
        secondary, it won't be communicated.

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Trieste Devlin:</span> This comes back to what
        I was saying before. The Manga is an example of the successful
        communication: where the movement is described more intelligibly with
        words and pictures anchored to something mutually intelligible. It
        assumes you, as the reader, with your understanding of physical reality,
        that you're gonna see that and you're gonna get it. Get it, with your
        real human body. And if you didn't have a real human body that you
        understood in the way they’re showing it being used, it wouldn't make
        sense.
