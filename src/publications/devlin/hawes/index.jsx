        Kate Hawes is a woodworker, and a maker and trader of spoons. In this
        essay, completed in 2022 while a student in the MACR program, they
        explore the discerning self-connection of spoon carvers. When a
        spoon-carver uses their mouth to get to know a wooden spoon, they are
        practicing experiential knowledge erotically, as Hawes puts it, via
        Audre Lorde. Which is to say: fully and acutely felt, in the doing.

        I have noticed that spoon carvers, when sitting around carving together,
        will stop and put the spoon they are working on in their mouth. This
        should not have surprised me, but it did the first time I saw it. The
        person goes through the motions of eating, bringing the bowl of the
        spoon, which is in some yet-done state of being carved, into their open
        mouth. They may move the fleshy insides of their mouth around the wood,
        feeling it from all sides with whatever sensory equipment is there at
        the ready. It is not savoring, but discerning. The bowl is still being
        formed and so there is a lot to think through as it sits there, a mute
        wood shape surrounded by sensing flesh. The spoon-carver may be thinking{" "}
        <em>a little off here, too thick there, smooth out that bump</em>. And
        then, getting the answer, the spoon carver pops it out of their mouth
        and gets on with the subtractive process of carving.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In spoon carving, failure is felt more than seen. How a spoon feels in
        hand and mouth is something that is tested, mulled over, and improved
        upon. Failure takes many shapes and forms, the worst being that a spoon
        I carve makes me gag when I put it in my mouth. It’s too thick in the
        middle of the bowl and rests heavy on my tongue. In spoon carving,
        feeling is <em>turned on</em> and <em>turned toward</em> in specific
        ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be attuned to the way spoons feel—in their making and in their
        exchange—is a kind of erotic connection. I use the word “erotic” to wake
        up something about feelings and craft that is relevant to spoon
        swapping. The erotic I am talking about is not sex, but more like what
        Black lesbian poet feminist Audre Lorde means when she uses “the erotic”
        to mean “a wellspring,” a “fullness of feeling,” and a source of “inner
        power” that, if said yes to, can spread throughout a life.
        <sup>

        </sup>{" "}
        I am not talking about erotic art objects or spoons as erotic fixations,
        but about an erotic connection in the experience of carving, using, and
        swapping spoons. In her manifesto-like essay “The Uses of the Erotic:
        The Erotic as Power,” written in 1978, Lorde points to an erotic of
        everyday life that is rooted in the body.

      <blockquote className="indented">

          “In the way my body stretches to music and opens into response,
          hearkening to its deepest rhythms, so every level upon which I sense
          also opens to the erotically satisfying experience, whether it is
          dancing, building a bookcase, writing a poem, examining an idea.”

        The erotic spoon refers to the experience of spoon carvers being alive
        in the ongoing making of spoons. For Lorde the erotic is a
        “self-connection” which can become “self- connection shared.” Swapping
        spoons with others is a way of sharing a deep attunement to one’s craft.
        She writes, “For the erotic is not a question only of what we do; it is
        a question of how acutely and fully we can feel in the doing.”

        </sup>{" "}
        I agree with Lorde that this satisfaction depends not on the{" "}
        <em>what</em> of doing but the <em>how</em>. The erotic spoon highlights
        experiential knowledge learned from the body.

        From its first inklings of growth when I see “a spoon shape” in a branch
        or stump, the spoon is brought into being for and around the body. It
        begins as a ragged piece of wood that I axe to the overall size of the
        type of spoon it will be. This could be a small “pocket spoon” that fits
        within the grasp of a hand and is made to fit a pocket; it could be an
        eater that is slightly longer, maybe the length of a hand; or it could
        be a cooking spoon that extends into a forearm and gives more leverage
        and distance from the pot. It could be a ladle if there is a deep bend
        built into the growth of the branch, giving it the feeling of a cupped
        hand at the end of an arm dropping down. If there is not enough
        thickness to the piece of wood, I might not make a spoon at all, but a
        flat pusher or butter spreader.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work a spoon does is determined by its shape. A spoon carver might
        start out with the thought of making a cooking spoon and end up
        whittling it away so that it becomes an eater. There may be snags and
        knots along the way where the wood dictates; detours are taken, and
        design is a flexible and impetuous thing. But there is a moment in the
        spoon’s shaping when food comes into mind.{" "}
        <em>What kind of work will the spoon do?</em> A spoon is a stick with a
        bowl on the end that extends the range of my body, allowing me to feel
        further.
        <sup>
          <em>
            <a href="#annotation-5">5</a>
          </em>
        </sup>{" "}
        A spoon might stir, scrape, shovel, carry, mash, pound, fold in, ladle,
        heap, or slice. I have a spoon gifted to me by a carver that has the
        thinnest tapering rats-tail handle. It flexes when I stir heavy oats or
        potatoes, but in a bowl of corn flakes it does just fine. I have seen
        carvers make eating spoons with bowls that are flat across their width,
        which will make a thin, hot broth roll off their sides. These are not
        failures, just spoons that fit a purpose that is food-specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        This task of making an object that feels good in the mouth is a peculiar
        one. What does it mean to make an object to fit the mouth? The mouth is
        a negative space, an orifice that is not easily pictured. It is a
        strange space flanked with orderly white blocks made of a shiny
        rock-hard material. Out of its center comes a shape-shifting red form. I
        make the rounded underneath of a spoon bowl thin enough so it enters and
        exits the mouth without too much ado. Upside down, a wooden eater in my
        mouth is just a wafer that fits between the dome of my palette and the
        cushion of my tongue.

        Wood and mouths are porous, so tastes are intermingled in the act of
        eating. Wood is a material that is always equalizing itself with its
        environment, which served it well when it was a tree and inhaling and
        exhaling the wetness of the world. I taste chemical compounds in wood,
        the species of wood, and the oil soaked into its fibers. Cherry has a
        tartness, some more than others; birch is a bit like hay; a certain
        apple spoon has a stink like decadent cheese and tastes of something
        fermenting in my mouth. I am eating tree particles, but I am also eating
        oil if there is any on the spoon. Certain oils turn rancid, never dry,
        and leave a bitterness on a spoon that seeps out across my tongue. It
        all becomes mixed into the experience of eating, which complicates the
        thought that I am eating something distinct from the utensil that brings
        food to mouth.

        It is useful to think about the way that spoons mix with our bodies when
        thinking about the intimacy of a spoon swap. Jody makes sure her swapped
        spoons get used; she rotates them into her family’s eating life. She
        says, “And if something happened to one of them, I would be, like,{" "}
        <em>oh, no, Kaylin got put in the dishwasher!</em>
        <sup>
          <em>
            <a href="#annotation-7">7</a>
          </em>
        </sup>{" "}
        A spoon may be a sign of its maker in use, as Jody folds it into her
        home life, thinking of Kaylin when she stirs the pot or rinses it at the
        sink before hanging it on a spoon rack. But it also may carry trace
        particles of its maker in its pores. The anthropologist Tim Ingold, who
        argues for a less divided sense of objects as distinct entities, has a
        way of seeing materials not as things with fixed boundaries, but in a
        flow and exchange with other things. The surfaces of things are more
        permeable than we think. Eating and breathing exemplify this point
        because matter moves in an obvious way in and out of us. He writes,
        “Things can exist and persist only because they <em>leak</em>: that is,
        because of the interchange of materials across the ever-emergent
        surfaces by which they differentiate themselves from the surrounding
        medium. The bodies of organisms and other things leak continually;
        indeed, their lives depend on it.”

        </sup>{" "}
        Ingold’s “leaky things” are conversant with the world, and like Jody’s
        spoons they pick up and discard particles as they move about.

        Unlike a sculpture that is captured under glass in a museum, a spoon is
        free to move about, to be in the weather of daily lives. Spoon carvers
        want the spoons they make to be used. A carver is thrilled when they see
        someone using their spoon to swipe the place where the pot’s bottom
        meets its side, to scrape hardened bits of food from the bottom of a
        pan, to bring a steaming pile of oatmeal up to a mouth.

        I notice the wood spoons in my kitchen grow fuzzy with use. Grain that
        was once burnished with the cut of a sharp knife becomes raised like
        fabric. Spoons erode quickly with washings, much quicker than rocks in a
        stream. The convex back of a bowl that was once a series of minute
        planes becomes a shape that feels sanded smooth. With air, sun, and
        water, a spoon’s edges become thirsty for oil. In the dishwasher, a wood
        spoon is shocked by the heat, and splits.

        Being alive to the exchange between bodies—wood, flesh, environment—is
        part of the craft of spoon carving. An erotics of spoon carving includes
        the hunger to dive deeply into a sodden log and find something within
        it. It describes the ability of craft to sharpen our imaginations and
        connect us to materials that breathe, sweat, age, soften, and leak. The
        erotic spoon expresses how spoons feel, how they meld with bodies, and
        how they are folded into intensely personal spaces. A spoon is not a
        fork; and I have never seen a wood fork traded so promiscuously as the
        spoons I see swapped with abandon. This might be because spoons’
        unending curves and roundness have more to say about love and sharing
        than does the sharpness of things with tines. A spoon’s bowl is round
        like the moon, an open orb that asks to be filled. In her poem, “On a
        Night of the Full Moon,” Audre Lorde begins: Out of my flesh that
        hungers/ and out of my mouth that knows/ comes the shape I am seeking
        for reason.
