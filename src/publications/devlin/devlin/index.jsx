        In the late summer of 2022, I shared readings from and conversations
        about my coursework with friends who are themselves somatics and craft
        practitioners. I asked about their somatic practices and their
        experience of communication of the tacit knowledge of movement and
        materials, and asked them to think of media that do the same kind of
        work as the craft readings. We thought together about how movement and
        stuff, like words, can be about movement and stuff, or can be in some
        way of it. Sometimes media are about movement and stuff, and sometimes
        they are about and from movement and stuff. In the following segment
        from one of these conversations, Trieste—craft practitioner,
        ex-engineer, sister to me—framed one of our discussions.

        If we’re trying to think of examples of good descriptions of physical
        reality that make, like, bodily sense to me immediately from books,
        Instagram, Manga—the good descriptions don’t exist unless they’re making
        a correct assumption about what we already know, in our bodies, as a
        reader, you know? I was thinking about dye stuff. So many dyers who are
        trying to explain natural dye processes, even like [in] the most
        beautiful, most respected book that has the most gorgeous pictures, the
        actual descriptions of how to do the process are, like, just a list of
        instructions and nothing about, like, what you’re noticing—what it
        smells like, what it feels like. Like, how goopy is it? Is there sandy
        texture in there? Those are the things that I want when I’m trying to
        learn this—and it’s all lacking in a lot of sources about these
        processes that I find online. The information has existed for as long as
        people have been dying things. But the embodied part, the texture part,
        isn’t in a lot of the information.

        So anybody who’s trying to share that information, whether it’s just a
        cute Instagram or if they’re trying to actually give you the
        information, it’s reduced down to this set of steps, and not the
        embodied information. And so, like, how, how could they tell us the
        information that both of us have from the physical experiences? There’s
        a broken line of our understandings in communication, which means that
        anybody who’s good at natural dying has read all this stuff, and then
        has figured it out themselves.
