      <h2>Material Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The chasm between producers and consumers leaves many of us estranged
          from beauty and a vital part of an ethical life.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Are you sitting comfortably? If so, how much do you know about the chair
        that’s holding you off the ground – what it’s made from, and what its
        production process looked like? Where it was made, and by whom? Or go
        deeper: how were the materials used to make the chair extracted from the
        planet? Most people will find it difficult to answer these basic
        questions. The object cradling your body remains, in many ways,
        mysterious to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quite probably, you are surrounded by many things of which you know next
        to nothing – among them, the device on which you are reading these
        words. Most of us live in a state of general ignorance about our
        physical surroundings. It’s not our fault; centuries of technological
        sophistication and global commerce have distanced most of us from making
        physical things, and even from seeing or knowing how they are made. But
        the slow and pervasive separation of people from knowledge of the
        material world brings with it a serious problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until about a century ago, most people knew a great deal about their
        immediate material world. Fewer and fewer do today, as commodities
        circulate with ever greater speed over greater distances. Because of the
        sheer complexity of contemporary production, even the people who do have
        professional responsibility for making things – the engineers and
        factory workers and chemists among us – tend to be specialists. Deepened
        knowledge usually also means narrowed knowledge. This tends to obscure
        awareness of the extended production chains through which materials,
        tools, components and packaging are sourced. Nobody – not an
        assembly-line worker, not a CEO – has a comprehensive vantage point. It
        is partly a problem of scale: the wider the view comes, the harder it is
        to see clearly what’s close at hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        In effect, we are living in a state of perpetual remote control. As Carl
        Miller argues in his book <em>The Death of the Gods</em> (2018),
        algorithms have taken over many day-to-day procedures. These algorithms
        are themselves driven by algorithms, in a cascade of interconnected
        calculation. Such automated decisionmaking is extremely efficient, but
        it has contributed to a crisis of accountability. If no one understands
        what is really happening, how can anyone be held responsible? This lack
        of transparency gives rise to a range of ethical dilemmas, chief among
        them our inability to address climate change, due in part to prevalent
        psychological separation from the processes of extraction, manufacture
        and disposal. For the same reasons, corporations take little
        responsibility for their outsourced workers. Scale and distance present
        consumers with related challenges: if you don’t know the people who were
        responsible for making the things in your life (and indeed, cannot
        imagine what their own lives might be like), it is difficult to find
        common cause with them. This gap between producers and consumers leads
        to a crack in the social fabric, where weeds of distrust and hatred can
        grow. Like any tool, technology in itself is not a bad thing. But the
        more we trust it to be the binding agent for our society, the more
        fragmented we seem to become.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what can be done about it? I have a modest proposal: let’s cultivate
        our material intelligence. Let’s try to recover our literacy in the ways
        of the physical world, just as someone who reads English can understand
        this sentence, and someone good with numbers can draw up a balanced
        budget. If we can anchor ourselves in this way, attending closely to the
        objects near to us, we might just be able to regain our bearings, and
        take greater responsibility for our actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though one does not need to be a maker to have material intelligence, it
        certainly helps. Knowledge of one craft or trade can inform an
        understanding of many others. And if you’re not particularly handy (I am
        not, myself) the next best thing is to watch someone who is.
        Experiencing a craftsperson at work, in person, is an incredible
        experience: it gives an immediate appreciation of the intimate
        choreography that real skill involves. It also cultivates curiosity
        about the material world in general, the habit of wondering how pencils
        or pillows were made, and by whom. This intuitive interest in
        materiality can help, in turn, to develop a healthy appreciation for
        human ingenuity. So much know-how can be embedded within even an
        apparently simple thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Material intelligence feels elusive, in part, because of practical
        detachment from the environment. It is also difficult to measure. When
        trying to describe this dimension of our awareness, people often use the
        phrase ‘tacit knowledge’, the understanding that resides in the body.
        There is no way to put workmanship fully into words. In this sense, it
        is quite different from other, better-recognised forms of intelligence.
        If you have ever taken an IQ test, you will remember that the questions
        are language-based, geometrical and mathematical puzzles, such as:
        ‘Mary, who is 16 years old, is four times as old as her brother. How old
        will Mary be when she is twice as old as her brother?’ (That’s right:
        24.) In his bestseller <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> (1995), Daniel
        Goleman popularised the{" "}
        <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG">
          idea
        </a>{" "}
        he borrowed from the psychologists John Mayer and Peter Salovey.
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) then became a favoured term in business
        schools and sociology departments, which developed means to measure it.
        Researchers made some satisfying discoveries; for example, it turns out
        that when solving a wide range of puzzles in a team setting, the average
        EQ of the team is more predictive of success than the average IQ, or the
        highest IQ score of any individual team member. Such experiments seem to
        prove that we would all benefit if we could only get along.
      </p>

      <p>
        Social structure itself tells of our increasing alienation from the
        material world. The know-how of material trades – farming, car repair,
        house construction, hairdressing – does not have the same standing as
        immaterial pursuits such as law, insurance or finance. Why? Not only
        because they can’t be objectively tested: these skills might be hard to
        set down on paper, or quantified, but proof of material intelligence is
        easy enough to see. Nor is it because of difficulty level. If a Wall
        Street trader and a tailor were to switch places for a day, neither
        would acquit themselves well; and while MBA programmes usually last two
        years, the traditional period of apprenticeship for a bespoke tailor is
        seven. Nor is the higher respect paid to white-collar workers based on
        some fair-minded calculation of benefit to society. If that were true,
        many corporate executives would be giving away money, not raking it in.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hierarchical arrangement of occupations, with people who work with
        their hands gathered mostly at the bottom, results simply from the
        exercise of power. It’s the result of a deep historical process, based
        in class conflict, and also involving prejudices based on gender and
        ethnicity. For the same reason, painting and architecture, historically
        practised by well-to-do white men, enjoy higher cultural status as ‘art’
        compared to creative pursuits practised by pretty much everyone else,
        which sit lower on the status ladder as ‘craft’. Measuring intelligence
        itself is part of the story: its quantitative and presumptively
        objective rendering preoccupied the eugenics movement. The overrating of
        technical and linguistic aptitude and the undervaluation of manual
        skills – the fact that we apply the word ‘smart’ to phones and
        appliances more readily than to our fellow humans – is not natural or
        right. It’s an inheritance from past injustice.
      </p>

      <p>
        To redress these wrongs, it’s important not just to recognise material
        intelligence, but also to understand it in general terms, as a whole.
        Skilled professions are often very specialised, and that can obscure
        connections between them. Craft is often contrasted to industry, for
        example. To some extent, this opposition makes sense. Artisanal
        production has often been understood as a remedy for the social ills
        that first arose during the industrial revolution: the grinding,
        subdivided labour of British mill towns prompted nostalgia for small
        country workshops. Yet thinking of craft and industry as opposites also
        leads to misperception. Whatever the scale, production always requires
        an understanding of materials, tools and processes somewhere along the
        line. The machines that make mass production possible, which spelled the
        end of so many traditional crafts, are themselves extraordinary feats of
        craftsmanship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Material intelligence plays a notable role in science, too. It is easy
        enough to caricature artisans as instinctive, and lab technicians as
        analytical. In fact, craft-makers possess extraordinary reserves of
        technical knowledge, while experimental scientists often talk about the
        importance of having ‘good hands’. The same goes for medicine. Caring
        for the human body demands much more than a knowledge of anatomy and
        chemistry; it’s a tactile business. Doctors and nurses routinely use
        touch to rapidly and accurately develop diagnosis. And as for surgeons,
        show me one without material intelligence, and I’ll say: thanks, but
        I’ll have my operation elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Material intelligence also crosses over the conventional divide between
        production and consumption. Makers and users can equally appreciate the
        warmth and grain of wood, the cool hardness of metal, the pliability of
        rubber. Just as skilled makers anticipate user needs and manage
        reactions to their work, an attentive user can imaginatively reconstruct
        the way that something was made. Ideally, an object serves as a bridge
        between these different perspectives. So material intelligence is shared
        across walks of life; it is a type of knowledge both wide and deep. Our
        tendency to chop it up into parts – craft versus industry, art versus
        science, producer versus consumer – is a pernicious and artificial habit
        that obscures the common cause of humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s return for a moment to the chair that you’re sitting in. It’s as
        good a point of departure as any for an exploration of the material
        world. How would you find out about it, if you wanted to? Thoughts turn
        first to the internet, of course – just Google it. Many other types of
        information (celebrity birthdays, nuanced discussions of long-ago
        military campaigns, full-length episodes of <em>Scooby-Doo</em>) are
        available at a moment’s notice. But it turns out to be very difficult,
        online, to find even basic information about a given physical thing. The
        incentive of manufacturers to keep their production processes private
        partly explains the silence. But counterintuitively, it’s also because
        of the conceptual depth of material things.
      </p>

      <p>
        The American artist Joseph Kosuth’s work <em>One and Three Chairs</em>{" "}
        (1965) serves as a good means of thinking this through. It seems simple
        at first: just a chair, flanked on one side by a photograph showing the
        same chair and, on the other, a dictionary definition of the word
        ‘chair’. It exemplifies the stance that Kosuth took in his{" "}
        <a href="http://www.lot.at/sfu_sabine_bitter/Art_After_Philosophy.pdf">
          essay
        </a>{" "}
        ‘Art After Philosophy’ (1969), in which he claimed that language-based
        thinking had exhausted itself. Art, Kosuth thought, was the best way to
        make further incursions into theoretical understanding. It could reach
        beyond language, and communicate the ‘unsayable’. The trajectory in the
        20th century, Kosuth wrote, was toward the ‘end of philosophy and the
        beginning of art’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unsurprisingly, professional philosophers did not agree, but even so
        Kosuth’s <em>One and Three Chairs</em> offers a valuable thought
        experiment. First, as the work’s title suggests, the arrangement might
        be either one thing seen three ways, or three utterly dissimilar things,
        bound together through the complex workings of language and
        representation. The three expressions of chairness conform to a classic
        tripartite division in semiotics: first, we have the referent (the chair
        itself); second, an arbitrary sign (the word ‘chair’); and third, an
        index (the photo, which mechanically reproduces the chair). It is also
        evident that the evenly weighted triad of one-and-three can easily be
        broken down into other structures: two flat things and an object; two
        things that are particular (this individual chair and its photo), and
        one prescriptive (a definition of chairs in general).
      </p>

      <p>
        One might also speculate on the cultural meaning latent in the
        photograph, which has the deadpan, straight-on composition of a mug
        shot. Even the dictionary entry has its subtleties, the anthropomorphic
        terminology of seat, back, legs and arms. How capacious is the
        definition? Is a rock a chair if you sit on it? If not, why not? Who
        arrives at a definition in the first place: do numerous examples
        accumulate into the meaning of a word, like arrivals at a party? Or does
        the concept precede the exemplars, imposing itself on them and giving{" "}
        <em>them</em> meaning?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>One and Three Chairs</em> is Kosuth’s best-known work, and he was
        one of the key protagonists of conceptual art. So the work has generated
        a great deal of discussion, and that was exactly the artist’s intention.
        He was concerned to question the workings of language and
        representation. Notice, though, the way that the physical chair takes
        precedence in the work, standing front and centre. You might even catch
        yourself referring to the chair in the middle as the ‘real one’. But if
        you are paying attention, you will wonder just what that means.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider: which of Kosuth’s three chairs would occupy the most memory in
        a computer’s hard drive? The lexicographical chair is about one kilobyte
        of data. The photograph, in high resolution, would take up perhaps 10
        megabytes. But the chair is, in a sense, infinite. How would you capture
        it? The most exacting digital scan will only map its surface features,
        and even these only to a certain fidelity. And even if you could somehow
        translate a chair’s atoms into data points, would that get you to the
        important stuff? The way your body feels as you sit, right now? The
        subtle messages about style and identity that a chair transmits to those
        who look at it? Our most sophisticated means of rendering the physical
        world into information are overmatched by this one unremarkable,
        everyday object.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is comforting that the humblest objects resist the ongoing march of
        technology into our lives in this way, like still rocks in a swift
        current. This anchoring quality is part of what makes material
        intelligence special. Understanding even a simple chair is an
        experiential matter. Googling it will only get you so far. Material
        intelligence is not just about compiling information. Treating an object
        as a point of entry into a production chain might be clarifying, for
        example; but it will not get you in touch with that thing. Material
        objects demand an aesthetic response, and a kinaesthetic one too.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a favourite coffee mug, which is nothing special. It’s one of
        those heavy ones that you get in American diners, with a shape like a
        little nuclear reactor and a satisfyingly chunky C-shaped handle. This
        design became popular following the Second World War, manufactured by
        the Victor Company at a factory in New York state previously used to
        manufacture ceramic insulators for telegraph and power lines. They used
        the same thick, slip-cast porcelain to make the mug, and a classic was
        born. That’s a fun fact – but it has little to do with my drinking
        preferences. When I raise it to my lips each morning, I feel the warmth
        that’s pervaded the clay, the gentle gloss of the glaze, the round roll
        of the rim as the coffee flows over. It connects in my mind to other
        ceramics I have known and loved, in museums and in my kitchen cabinets,
        sometimes made by friends, other times in factories far away. Every time
        I use it, I’m situating myself within a broad human fabric.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pleasure that this mug gives me exemplifies a crucial aspect of
        material intelligence, and the promise it holds. Like certain other
        topics – sports, weather and food among them – an interest in objects
        cuts across demographic lines. Material things can even operate
        independently of language; they don’t require translation. For this
        reason, they have often been the advance emissaries of exchange, as when
        Chinese ceramics poured into Europe in the 17th century. In those days,
        porcelain vessels decorated with blue dragons prompted a range of
        responses, from awe and curiosity to envy – including the desire to
        imitate the imports using domestic materials. Eventually, knockoffs of
        Chinese blue and white were made all over the world, from Turkey to the
        Netherlands to Philadelphia. Did the copying involve economic
        competition and blatant exoticism? Sure. But fundamentally, this was a
        process in which cultures encountered and learned about one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        A similar potential to enhance mutual respect exists today. Just
        imagine: what if we taught children in primary schools to identify and
        manipulate a basic lexicon of materials, to understand their properties
        and potential uses? What if vocational training met with as much respect
        as academic education? One result might be to enliven us all to the
        physical world around us. The embrace of such connoisseurship could
        change the world for the better. This is not the same as encouraging
        luxury production. ‘Better’, here, does not mean market value. It does
        not imply rare substances, or extraordinary expenditures of workmanship.
        It just means an object that feels extraordinarily right to you, as my
        $7 diner mug does to me. Once I found it, I didn’t need to keep buying
        coffee cups. I was satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to look for the same sense of resolution, satisfaction, in all the
        things I buy: the curtains in my house, the leather bag I use to carry
        my laptop, the jeans I wear as I type these words, and yes, the desk
        chair in which I’m sitting. I could not have made any of these things
        myself. It so happens that I met all the people who did, though. The
        curtain fabric is by the Brooklyn weaver Scott Bodenner; the bag by a
        leatherworker in Cambridge, England, called Ian Stevens; the jeans by
        Raleigh Denim, in North Carolina; and the chair by the late Art
        Carpenter (his real name, believe it or not). I’d vouch for any of them
        to go to an elementary school and explain what they do. That might help
        to impart kids with a healthy interest in skill and enterprise, and also
        a worthwhile set of values: creativity, care and commitment.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of the things I’ve just described was all that expensive, but I
        feel I can claim ‘connoisseurship’ of them (in the oldest sense of the
        word, which comes from the French for knowledge, or awareness). As a
        museum curator, I found a line of work that brings me into contact with
        makers, which reminds me of the beauty and vitality of things. But the
        feeling that I am trying to describe is open to all. And it is
        instinctive – even if we’re not all in touch with that instinct these
        days. Reconnecting with it shouldn’t be hard: it can be as simple as
        picking up a pretty pebble while walking along the beach, in serene
        solitude or in the company of loved ones, and bringing it home as a
        reminder of a day well spent. For this purpose, any pebble will do. It
        takes just a moment to invest it with specialness.
      </p>

      <p>
        It might sound utopian, but if everyone could extend that same simple
        attitude to the things in their lives, the benefits would be
        incalculable. The bad news is that the atomisation of our society is
        getting worse all the time. The good news is that, though it might
        appear otherwise, we actually are all in it together – together with one
        another, and with material things, which can give us purchase in an
        increasingly disorienting world. We live, day by day, in a torrent of
        negativity. Often it seems unbridgeable. But objects can be our stepping
        stones. Recognise them for what they are, and we might just get to the
        other side.
