        In these segments from a conversation with woodworker Alexis Rosa
        Caldero, we discuss the communication Caldero is working to create in
        their design and craftwork. This “communication” aims to remain in the
        physical plane. Information is enacted into the forms of chairs which
        heal over time. Sitting in one of these chairs could teach a body, an
        individual user, new tacit physical knowledge in the adjustment of their
        bones and joints. In the making, Caldero enriches and hones her
        practical philosophy of wood-first chair-making. In conversation with
        clients, they connect the practical philosophy of woodworking with the
        practical philosophy of somatics—that our experiences and movements
        create our bodies’ understandings. The text has been edited slightly
        edited, for clarity.

        <span className="speaker">Miriam Devlin:</span> I know that in your
        professional life you are often working to communicate about “stuff,”
        while always seeking actual space, and time, to practice with the stuff
        itself, and that the latter is maybe harder to find. Every time we talk,
        I hear you sitting in this place of “stuff” in your own mind, and then
        translating it to communication. With makers you are directing, or
        educating, and program managers, or clients you are working with. Does
        that does sound like what your experience is?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Alexis Rosa Caldero:</span> Yeah, I think that
        that's true. There's like always a kind of just searching like, for
        access to space and materials. To realize anything, whether it's this
        chair project or something else. Then, another big part of it for me is
        always this, for lack of a better term, skillshare. How do we engage
        with the community? For those who want to know these things, how do we
        learn alongside one another. How can we have those kinds of spaces?
        They're few and far between. Places you can actually open yourself up to
        learn something new. If you're a beginner, or if you're not thinking in
        these realms.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">MD:</span> Would you tell me about your
        experience of realizing that you wanted to work on your embodied healing
        chair project?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">ARC:</span> Yeah. When I was at Nakashima,
        I've probably told you the story… Nakashima woodworkers are really
        focused.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Their whole philosophy starts with the material: how do we look at it,
        and study it to create pieces that will celebrate the material. So, not
        starting with the idea for a piece of furniture first, but starting with
        material and designing around the material in ways that will last
        hopefully many generations. It's not just well crafted to create visual
        balance and harmony, but also structural integrity without taking any
        shortcuts. They're also one of the few woodworking studios where
        woodworkers have the luxury to be able to not take shortcuts. But all of
        that said, when I started working there, I think, in the back of my
        mind, I had this question of: how do you do this?{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you look at material, at this specific material, and honor it,
        and work with it? Some of that, I think I innately already knew, but
        didn't trust that I knew. So, there was validation in my work there,
        getting to just live it and do it all the time. I was adding to my
        knowing, and the knowing that I knew, and growing the knowing of
        starting with the material. While I was there, there was another
        woodworker, who came from Japan, who had also had a longtime
        appreciation for the Nakashima studios work. He's a chairmaker now.
        Maybe he wouldn't identify just as a chairmaker. His name is Tak
        Yoshino. Since we worked together, he has started a school of
        woodworking in Japan. He has been building it out from scratch. The
        architecture, and a very meta experience, teaching an approach in living
        that craft philosophy.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless: he was at Nakashima at a time when I was working there. One
        day we all kind of took a pause from our work. He had brought parts of a
        chair and assembled it in front of us and was describing this chair with
        the help of an assistant. There was a language barrier. The premise
        behind this chair, really left a large imprint on me. He has studied
        with chiropractors and with Zen masters. Their practice is one of
        meditation, for like 10 hours on end. He's from Japan where the concept
        of sitting in chairs is relatively new. So he's coming at chair making
        with a constellation of philosophies and approaches and understandings.
        He combined all of those studies and knowings into this chair that he
        showed us, designed for an individual, so that without the use of upper
        muscles, it suspends the tailbone such that when you're breathing in,
        while sitting in the chair over time, there's slow reparative work that
        happens along the spine. I think it was also largely informed by his
        wife who has a musculatory issue. Something along the lines of MS. I
        don't know if that's what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, all of these things that just for me, I think, answered the
        question of why. Why do this work? So if my original question at
        Nakashima was “how,” I felt like that was slowly answered in these other
        ways. It was much more of an internal thing. Then there was like, this
        big question of “why?” Why there are 1000s upon 1000s of chairs out
        there. Like, mass-produced plastic chairs that make things affordable.
        There are people trying to make chairs for other reasons, but even then
        it’s often through the study of “ergonomics,” like what does that even
        mean? By CDC standards it's the study of trying to mitigate issues in
        muscles or the body, but within the context of the work environment.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-2">2</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        So it's this very capitalistic approach and viewpoint.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        For me Tak’s chair was the first time that I really encountered an
        answer to “why” handmake chairs from wood and that large imprint has
        made me want to explore like, yeah, there's there's muscular issues
        there, and I'm sure there's like not just one way to approach this. This
        all made me think of all the other ways that we hold stuff in our
        bodies, whether that's trauma, or what have you like physical trauma, or
        mental, or just the day-to-day stuff that we go through, and we interact
        with chairs quite a bit in our culture now. So, what if we had more of
        an understanding of that kind of somatic journey that our bodies go
        through? And how can furniture play a more supportive role, in a small
        way. I don't really think it's going to save us. But I think it's
        something, and it's a space that I crave to know more about.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I would love to be working with our somatic experts of all different
        backgrounds and expertise, as a kind of collaborative project. I know
        that I can make chairs and work with wood. That's probably not something
        that most of our somatic experts will know. How do we learn from one
        another and co-create? I'm just super fascinated with this. That's where
        I've been kind of stuck on this idea, that’s been growing and brewing.
        I've started to make community connections. And now come January, I'm
        excited, I'll be able to take the first physical steps in the woodshop,
        towards it. We'll see where it goes!

          Caldero’s Grew-Sheridan Adjustment Rig. They made this prototype based
          on a design for an adjustable template, for use in designing chairs
          for the comfort of individual users, by furniture makers Carolyn and
          John Grew-Sheridan, in the 1990s. At the time of publication, Caldero
          is at work iterating on this design to make the rig usable in their
          project of making of chairs for a wider range of bodies. Photograph by

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">MD:</span> It sounds like part of what you're
        interested in doing is, you want to work with somebody who has
        knowledge, you want to work with people whose knowledge of bodies, and
        somatics is the same as the kind of knowledge you have of materials. Is
        your intention to learn that yourself, so that by the end of the
        process, you have somatic understanding of bodies, as well as wood, and
        you can kind of weave those together?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">ARC:</span> I think that's part of a hope,
        that through this my overall approach or my mind/world view, will… that
        we will leave some sort of imprint on one another. I’ve picked 100, the
        number 100, that quantity, because that feels like a large enough, like
        a deep enough dive, where I hopefully can have an intimate knowing of
        this new thing, right. After I build 100 chairs - I'm imagining this is
        going to be like years and years - who knows if I can like even build
        more chairs after that. We'll see. But maybe it will become less of a
        cognitive collaboration at some point. I think that with this
        individualistic approach, like designing <em>for</em>, like tailoring
        somebody's clothes for them, that it would never not be some form of a
        collaboration or co-creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I think, based off of the reading that I have been doing on
        somatics, and the conversational understandings that I've gained from
        somatic experts, that it, how a body holds trauma, is different for
        everybody. How it lives in the body is always different. I don't know
        that there's ever going to be a way that I could grow in understanding
        so that I could know more than that person who I'm designing for.
        There's something in there that is touching on… even if it's not
        specifically what you're asking for right now, it's a little bit about
        that question of hyper-specialization. Who becomes the bearer of the
        knowledge. Maybe this leads to conversations around gatekeeping, and all
        of that sort of stuff.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">MD:</span> What I see from what you just said,
        is like that you have a lot of respect for knowledge, of any knowledge
        staying where it is. That understanding of an individual's somatic
        experience is in that individual, it is not anywhere else. And you can
        learn from that and work in a collaborative way to accommodate that. But
        your switch from designing to tailoring is an interesting word change
        that I think, I think I hear what you're saying. I also hear that it's
        like you're bringing the same respect, where you learned to trust your
        own knowledge while working at Nakashima, to this project, where you're
        saying that the material knowledge of somatics is the same kind of thing
        as having the ability to know wood really well. And you recognize that
        other people have that kind of knowledge in other ways, and have been
        practicing it, and you've been practicing something else, and you're
        trying to bring your practices to their practice.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        I'm interested in the way you talk about knowing wood, and about how
        communicating that kind of knowledge in the shop at Nakashima was. Can
        you trust that who you're talking to is seeing the same thing that
        you're communicating about? Because you're inside your head, and they're
        inside theirs… what was that like?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">ARC:</span> I think it was different.
        depending on who you're talking to you. Whether it's a prospective
        client, and you're trying to help them look at this rough board that
        we've pulled that looks very different than any other tabletop that they
        would have probably had access to, right.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, there's the client communicating with us, or me to the clients, or
        me to other woodworkers. And then, from even amongst the woodworkers,
        there's me to this person who was there for four years, and some folks
        who were fresher than me. And some had been around since the 70s. They
        have their own knowing. Not just of the material and how to literally
        make the pieces, but also that final touch, a good sense of what looks
        right. Maybe they wouldn't be able to design it from the start, or look
        at the wood and be like, “Oh, that's how it should be.” That's how it
        kind of actually wants to be.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The words that we used would be different depending on who we would talk
        to. But for clients, it starts with photographs, and looking at it in
        its rough state, long before helping them envision what it might look
        like with oil like getting a closer approximation finished. And then
        doing a lot of pencil sketches to help them visually, or to help them
        envision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would, for instance, get a request from a client. And they'd say: “I
        have this much room or I want this size of a table, or I want to seat
        this many people,” or whatever. Then we would ask for photos and try to
        get a sense of the room, and also try and get a sense of what they're
        looking for, and whether we had a shared terminology. Like: “are you
        looking for something really sculptural? Basically: what's your vibe? Do
        you want something really clean and linear and architectural?” We can't
        just show you a bunch of photos of finished tables, necessarily, because
        that gets dangerous. Because we can't make more than one table that ever
        looks exactly like that. The bases were all relatively established but
        would have to be redesigned per the individual piece, the slab that we
        found, to make the physics of it all work, and then also to make it feel
        right, for lack of a better term. Like if it's feel, if it feels too
        chunky, or feels too light, you know, like there's a certain poetry
        about it that has to fit the client and the wood.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they're looking for something pretty, strong and linear on the
        bottom, that's going to lend itself to certain slabs. We design some
        bases to work with tops that are more uniform, right, and like there's
        less undulation happening, but it's still a natural piece. Trees just
        grow in such different ways. We were working from such a large and
        varied catalog where the world is our oyster, in terms of lumber
        inventory. That inventory was over 50 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the tree is cut down, keeping it in sequential order, you can see
        the tree in profile, and choose a slice. There's up to a certain point
        where you can do something like a book match. There's only so many per
        tree; you can only do that so many times before you get so far away from
        a true book match with the slices from one tree. Each part of the tree…
        it's almost like, like a butcher, right? Who had like their vert
        specific uses of different parts of the tree.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        So when we'd get a request, you know, I'd kind of literally go climb
        around in the pole barn and select pieces so that if somebody didn't
        know what their vibe was, I would get three distinct pieces. Like: “this
        is something really sculptural in form, but this is really uniform.” I
        was always kind of interested in the sculptural pieces and finding the
        right person for those, so I’d throw in something a little crazy, and
        then help them figure out what works for them, even if they might not
        have the words. We always try to encourage an in-person visit, although
        that isn't always possible, for a number of different reasons. Then we
        would take them through the wood in person, and do some drawings, and go
        from there.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        With the woodworkers it was much more about like, there had to be just
        complete and utter trust. With the shape, the form, the balance, where
        we think they should start. With the technical drawing that I do in
        pencils, 1/16th of an inch on the page was an inch in real life. I'd
        sketch out what the grain was going to look like, and the butterflies,
        all of the knots and intricacies. I'd share that drawing not just with
        the woodworkers, but with the client. Then, working daily with the
        woodworkers: they'd make a piece, and then once they got to a point
        where something significant needs to happen, that's not reversible, like
        cutting a sheet, like the fine tuning the shape of the piece, we mark it
        in pencil and chalk on the actual slab so that, you know, it might shift
        slightly from the drawing.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        It's all by hand. It might not be perfectly accurate representation. Or
        as we're working with the wood, something might open up, like,
        physically, a knot might open up, and that would need more addressing.
        Or maybe some other sort of tension in the wood that we couldn't have
        anticipated, until we start cutting into it. So that would require an
        adjustment in our approach. We'd sit with it some more, and draw
        physically on the piece. But it was always a conversation that was
        happening as the pieces were being made. One woodworker would make the
        piece from beginning to end. It's not like a factory line up where this
        person's making this leg, and this person is making this part. They are
        also getting to know that piece of wood. And then we're getting to know
        it together, as we go down the line. The only thing that was different
        or separated is the finishers. There were dedicated finishers.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">MD:</span> What was that like in the shop with
        you being the one who draws these images and then says this is how it's
        going to be. You were translating, from the wood, to the vision with the
        clients, to the woodworkers. What kind of language would share with the
        woodworkers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">ARC:</span> It’s an abstract concept that I've
        put out there for you, I'm trying to give it some more concreteness to
        explain or think, walk through how I might encounter that with a
        woodworker. For instance: if there was like a loose knot, or bark
        enclosure, something that we thought was permanently intact, but then a
        crack in the wood revealed itself, because it opened up throughout the
        refinement of the milling process. The conversation would just be them
        coming up to me, looking at my design and saying: “hey, something's
        happened. Can you tell me what to do next?” I'd look at it and be like:
        “Okay, well, I think that needs a butterfly of this proportion, and of
        this wood, instead of this other proportion. And at this place, or maybe
        it needs another, a second butterfly to stabilize it.” There was one
        woodworker who just retired recently, in the past couple of years, after
        I left. He was really good at saving knots, like it was his personal
        challenge that he would take to, to save the knots that came loose
        throughout any process. He would replace it make it look like you could
        never tell. He just found a lot of personal joy in that process. They're
        such tiny little, sometimes the size of a pencil lead, they'll just fall
        out. Other times he would save it, because he could use it for another
        replacement. If there was a knot that we just couldn't convince some a
        client to fall in love with the concept of a hole in their tabletop, he
        just had this box full of knot-holes to use. We were just always like:
        how can we approach this in a way that's not <em>hyper</em>? That
        doesn’t put a focus on the man-made aspect of it. It's always going to
        be a collaboration between nature and the woodworker. But how can we
        make that soft, and not loud and outspoken? I don't know that I can
        answer like how I would approach that conversation with a woodworker.
        But maybe that offers some insight there.

        <NavLink to="/devlin/adamson">Case for Material Intelligence</NavLink>”.
        I got through, like maybe the first quarter of it so far. It felt very
        much like conversations that you and I have; I very much identified with
        a lot of it. It opened up talking, this is probably why you shared it,
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-3">3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        it opened up talking specifically about like, questioning the use of
        chairs, and as the sitter in this chair, like: Could you name any of the
        processes or materials that it's been over? How deep is your knowing of
        this thing that you use every day? And so that really resonated as just
        a provocative question.

        I will be finishing the read because it strikes me. I'm intrigued. But,
        other things that I have been reading: <em>My Grandmother's Hands</em>{" "}
        by Resmaa Menakem. It’s about somatics of like, racial trauma, and
        healing hands, which means small movements and practices. There's
        connection there. Like, I think it's something that I wish more of us
        were doing as a collective society, instead of blowing all of our stuff
        through one another, but like sitting with it, and kind of like moving
        through it. And part of that comes from a knowing or recognizing that it
        lives within us. Because we keep passing it down, right? And through.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also been reading,{" "}
        <em>What Can a Body Do? How We Meet the Built World</em> by Sara
        Hendren. I've started that. I'm in the opening chapter. A friend gave it
        to me. It's super fascinating so far. It opens up from the perspective
        of some sort of design engineer professor who shared a prompt with their
        students about addressing disability, whatever that means. I think they
        find a different guest expert for each chapter. In one chapter the
        client is a little person, who is maybe four feet tall, and she is a
        public speaker. She presented the design engineer with a project for the
        class and she was like: “I need a podium. There's nothing out there for
        me. Here are the parameters. It needs to be, lightweight, because I
        travel all the time. It needs to be collapsible.” She defined what
        designing for disability was in this case. And in doing so threw all the
        students’ preconceived notions out the window, they had been like: “I am
        going to be designing this super prosthetic, you know, this almost
        robotic thing. They had all of these preconceptions before even knowing
        the person, or what their needs were, and what impacts them the most on
        a daily basis. Then the person defined that for them. Were they not
        given this context, they probably wouldn't have been heard. I think
        that's a little bit of what I was talking about earlier, as far as like:
        will it ever be less of an interweaving, less of a collaboration,
        essentially. I think that's also what I was thinking about as far as
        like, whoever I'm designing for is going to know the most about what
        they need. Hopefully I'll get to a point where I can have more tools to
        offer suggestions, based off of like, all the multitudes of experiences
        that are people and their experiences that I'm encountering. Maybe we
        can grow those things together.
