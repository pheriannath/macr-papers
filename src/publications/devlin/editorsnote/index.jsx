        A subset of writing about craft focuses on <em>what the body knows</em>

        about materials and movement. Much more than some subset of human
        practice is about or emanates from human bodies engaging in material
        practice, knowledgeably. During my time as a student in the MA in
        Critical Craft Studies program (MACR), I have found myself in
        conversation time and again in which we, craft practitioners and
        scholars, bump up against the singularity, the itself-ness, of the
        outcomes of physical practice in the experience of the practitioners.
        With this bumping-against, we find a tenuous border: stuff is stuff, and
        it isn’t words. And yet: we manage translations.{" "}

        Other somaticists (like myself three years ago) may have read little
        from the field of craft scholarship. I have assembled a set of readings
        about the internal knowledge of material practice to nourish
        conversations among them. This collection is a reader that depicts and
        explores embodied and materially anchored perspectives on craft and
        movement. It contains reprints of writing from the field of modern craft
        writing that center, analyze, or pour forth from (these are all
        different things) material practice. You will also find snippets from
        conversations with my friends in which we aim to clarify what kind of
        connections we see between movement and materials, and language about
        movement and materials. Some of the language stands as an intermediary,
        constructed and shared to evoke embodied knowledge. Some provides,
        instead, more of a schematic overview.

        In a “birds of a feather” breakout room during the 2021 Craft Ways:
        Tending to Craft virtual symposium, I hosted a small group discussion on
        a crowd-sourced topic. The question posed: “How can we navigate the
        divide between tacit/haptic knowledge of making and the written form
        upheld by academia?” Both weaver Hellen Ascoli and texture artisan
        Heather Hanft

        were present. They shaped the air with their hands as they talked, and
        described themselves as “a materials person,” for whom academic
        knowledge does not result in “fingertip and bodily knowledge,” and as a
        “mediator between artists and craftspeople” who creates writing
        “between.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-3">3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        This conversation and their work have been on my mind while I assemble
        this collection, which I intend to communicate both material and
        academic knowledge to “materials people,” and also to remind us of the
        ways that words may be about our fingertips while nonetheless failing to
        reach them.{" "}

        If you look at a cup full of water and think about what would happen if
        you pushed it over, you can play it as something like a little video in
        your head, right? It has more mass than a video. I can fill the cup up
        with more water, on the table or in my mind, and the imagined watching
        now contains a bigger spill. That imagining is a sort of translation.
        Any version of a cup spilling that isn’t an actual cup spilling is a
        translational imagination. Maybe when your friend points to a cup and
        explains what would happen—the wobble, splash, and clatter—while
        threatening with a finger to push, as together we look at the shaking
        water in the hard, red, plastic pizza-chain cup set next to all of our
        laptops, the evocation will feel more immediate. Some language creates
        internal space that works with mechanisms we know well. Sometimes it
        describes without evoking.

        I selected the included texts from and around readings from my assigned
        MACR coursework about the kind of experience that is in the middle of
        craft and movement practices. I made my choices based on ineffable
        criteria about a feel for material and movement, and a certain kind of
        readability.

        In this reader, <em>Craft Practiced</em> Writing from Robin Wall
        Kimmerer, unfolds ways human knowing deeply anchors our bodies to our
        environments. Glenn Adamson considers material intelligence, from a
        distanced perspective. Phoebe Kuo’s ethnography flows from a sensory
        account of swimming. An interview with woodworker Alexis Caldero, who
        designs chairs that position users to heal, will be our bridge between
        craft and functional somatics, demonstrating other axes of translation
        between materials. Margaret Boden considers possibilities of embodied
        knowing as they relate to either craft or art practices. Kate Hawes
        shows the clarity of embodiment tangled in literal and figurative human
        constructions. Interspersed are moments from conversations I have
        participated in over the past year with my sister and her partner, which
        engage and explore the prospects of translation between movement and
        language.
