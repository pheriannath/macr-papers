        Phoebe Kuo wrote this sensory ethnography in 2020 while a student in the
        MACR program. The essay, alone within this collection, is a direct
        account of experience without analysis.

        I visit Lake Michigan several times a week to go swimming with a friend.
        The swim begins at home, when I pack my equipment and head to the lake.
        As with woodworking, preparation is part of the practice. But I will
        skip the drive to the lake, listening for waves while walking toward the
        beach, and the first glimpse of sand and water—and start with entering
        the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approaching the water causes a narrowing of the senses. I am no longer
        tracking the air temperature, the sunshine, or other beach-goers. My
        focus goes to my feet as I walk toward the ever-shifting waterline.
        Unlike the captive water of a swimming pool, the lake surges to meet me.
        I put one foot in front of the other, but the rushing waves cause
        pebbles and sand underfoot to give way, and my feet sink suddenly, and
        my body wobbles and rights itself by shooting my arms out to the sides.
        A few moments later, I am chest deep, and cold water finally begins to
        steal into my wetsuit, starting at the ankles and wrists and seeping
        toward my core. Walking becomes effortful. The impulse travels from my
        hip socket down my leg; my leg, submerged, moves sluggishly; my foot
        seeks the mushy sandy floor. One arm swings in a wide arc from front to
        back, pushing against the water which propels my body forward; then the
        other follows suit. A wave rears up directly ahead of me and I take a
        breath before it hits me in the face. My body leans into the wave lest I
        allow it to knock me backward, and both arms reach out to sweep the wave
        behind me. I am on the other side, only to see another wave approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I glance to my left; my friend is running joyfully toward the next wave.
        I make a split-second decision to duck dive under the wave instead of
        trying to get over it. I hold my breath and aim my head and hands at the
        base of the wave. My feet kick off from the floor and push my body
        horizontally into a fast-moving wall of water. Immediately the sky is
        blotted out and my field of vision goes jade green. My face feels a
        shock of cold. Simultaneously I feel the forward momentum of my body and
        the resistance of the wave passing around me. My arms paddle twice in a
        rapid, urgent breaststroke, while at the same time my legs kick like a
        frog. This is not the disciplined and regular breaststroke of open-water
        swimming—this is a survival stroke, asymmetrical and reactive, the only
        direction it knows is up. Fast bubbles stream out of my mouth and scrape
        past my ears. My lungs want air. I break through the surface and as soon
        as my mouth is clear of the water it opens and gulps one breath and then
        another. The water has big swells, and as I tread in place I feel my
        body rise and fall with them, but when I swivel my head to look behind
        me, I see we are now beyond the breaking of the waves.

        Commencing with freestyle swimming is merely a matter of decreasing my
        buoyancy. My hands stop paddling and my body sinks. I inhale, duck my
        head, and stretch out my arms. As my view changes from clouds and trees
        and buildings to that endless green expanse, I exhale and allow my legs
        to float upward. With a few kicks, my body takes a horizontal position
        and begins to move through the water. As my right arm takes a stroke, my
        body rolls slightly to the side and my head turns so my face exits the
        water. There is more chop than usual, and when I inhale I catch equal
        parts water and air in my mouth and choke on the lake. The next time, I
        twist my neck as far as it will go, and my right arm strokes more
        forcefully, which elevates my chest and head high out of the water. I
        take a full breath and turn my face forward to sight a green buoy in the
        distance. As I swing my right arm through the air, it hinges at the
        elbow, looking more like the coupler in a four-bar mechanism than a
        windmill, so that my hand skims the water and re-enters almost parallel
        to the water’s surface, fingers pointing forward. As I roll back to
        center, I see the waterline pass over my goggles and feel the cold water
        wash over my face until it is fully submerged again. Now my right arm
        extends forward as my left arm takes a stroke.
      </p>

        Because it is cold, my lungs constrict and it is hard to breathe. I come
        up gasping and cannot draw a lungful. I will my legs and arms to keep
        moving. I switch from breathing every three strokes to every two. When I
        surface for air, I take a long draught and attempt to catch my breath.
        It doesn’t matter that I have swum this lake dozens of times—a visceral
        panic rises in spite of myself. My reptilian mind is active when I swim,
        caught in a struggle with my rational mind and my body. Under these
        conditions, the water suddenly feels threatening, the waves adversarial.
        Though I know I will not die today, my body thinks otherwise. But this
        is part of the fun.

        The thing that draws me to lake swimming is the attention it demands.
        The most basic elements remain constant: the arms stroke, the legs kick,
        and the lungs breathe. Aside from that, all bets are off. Unlike with
        pool swimming, my mind and body are alert, from my first stroke to my
        last, to constant changes in the water that require me to adjust on the
        fly. Today, I propel my body south while large swells roll in direct
        opposition. I feel them rock and lift my body. It is important to know
        where I am in a swell before I attempt to take a breath. As the water
        lifts me, there is a brief moment of suspension. I can’t rely on my
        eyes, as I can see only the churning green water all around me. Instead,
        my body recognizes the weightless feeling from a playground swing set
        when I reach the apogee of the swing’s arc before plunging back toward
        the earth. As soon as my body crests, I turn my body and head toward the
        sky and snatch a breath of air. With the next breath, I miscalculate and
        my face encounters a wall of water. For the following breath, I launch
        myself out of the water only to have it drop out from under me, and I
        fall a short distance back into the water with a slap. Through it all,
        my mouth opens at the moment my face is clear of the water, and snaps
        shut as soon as I have taken a breath. I push air forcefully out through
        my nose to keep the choppy water from going up it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we arrive back at our starting point. Pulling our goggles up,
        we dog paddle back to the shallows and walk back onto dry land.
