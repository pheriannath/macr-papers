        The future of craft is a specter that haunts us even now. As Mark Fisher
        says about hauntology, the ghosts we live with are not so much past as
        future: the future we were taught to anticipate but that never really
        arrives. Those of us in craft studies anticipate a future where craft
        practices flourish: a world where all forms of making are forms of
        knowledge, where work is autonomous and creative, where we exhilarate in
        the free play of process and experiment. This vision only grows more
        captivating in an economy built on precarious and downtrodden workers, a
        present that seems doomed to be eternal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some present versions of craft reach back into a pre-industrial era for
        this Arcadian dream (you might cobble shoes by hand, or brew your own
        beer) and some do not (you might design software for knitting patterns,
        or print your own vase). What all craft pasts and futures have in common
        is a social imagination where the world we live in might be quite
        different from the one we have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghosts, then, are the residue left behind by “the failure of the
        future.”

        As the Critical Craft Studies MA program dies, we are haunted by the
        future we imagined: that we would be part of an ever-growing association
        of scholars who would materialize the field of craft studies. We are all
        here because we wanted, collectively, to make the future field we
        desired. The golden age of craft studies still hovers somewhere past the
        horizon. It might get here sooner than we think. It might never come at
        all. Or, possibly, we did not recognize it while it was here.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        While the program dissolves, the scholars it generated will continue to
        dream new things. Seeds of craft studies, blown by diasporic winds,
        settle into new ground. We make new futures everywhere.
