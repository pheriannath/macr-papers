      <h2>The Liminist</h2>
      <p>
        “The opposite of the specialist is not the generalist, but the Liminist.
        Where the generalist picks the low-hanging fruit of knowledge, the
        Liminist operates in the liminal interzones between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a world of disconnected silos stretching vertically into the sky, the
        Liminist stretches horizontally across them. They function as guides,
        navigating people across these intersecting planes to comprehend the
        work and ideas of their unrelated peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is very much its own specialization, but where all other domains
        specialize in Form, the Liminist specializes in Non-Form. The evidence
        of their work exists at the intersections between objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        These intersections have their own space, presence, and tangibility.
        They are just as ‘original’ and ‘unique’ as the objects that the
        intersection weaves together.
      </p>

      <p>
        A talented Liminist must be a master translator, able to communicate and
        comprehend across domains. They must be a master weaver, able to take
        individual strands across many domains and pattern them together. A
        master diplomat that can manage the egos of others. They must be
        comfortable operating in ambiguity, which is their playground.”
