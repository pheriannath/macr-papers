        “The broken vessel is not transformed into ‘art’ because of the
        destruction of function, but rather that it remains within the realm of
        craft while being ascribed conceptual meaning. The German term{" "}
        <em>aufhebung</em>
        relates to Hegelian philosophy, describing ‘the process by which the
        conflict between two opposed or contrasting things [...] is resolved by
        the emergence of a new idea, which both preserves and transcends them,’
        becomes useful in understanding the duality of destruction and creation
        (‘<em>Aufhebung</em>’). Translated as sublation in English, the term
        articulates the process by which the vessel’s previous form is negated,
        while still maintaining and preserving an element of the previous state
        within the new synthesis (‘Sublate’).”
