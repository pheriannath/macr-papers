          “Queerness is not yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way,
          we are not yet queer. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel it
          as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We
          have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that
          can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. The
          future is queerness’s domain. Queerness is a structuring and educated
          mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of
          the present. The here and now is a prison house.”

        Muñoz is telling me that queerness is not necessarily definable in the
        present and is not something that is permanent. It is something that is
        in comparison to time, it is the historically marginalized. Historically
        could mean years, days, or a minute, but it is hard to place it, to
        contextualize it in the exact moment we are breathing in.{" "}

        It positions queerness as a horizon, something that is moved toward but
        never touched. It is the state of becoming or unbecoming that is in
        constant motion. It is these ideas that have me interested in the
        motions or movements that craft facilitates. Seeing objects as
        cartographic marks that map our interactions, engagements, and desires.
        It is a way to think with craft just as I think with queerness. Both
        terms are fantastically slippery and resist binaries, as they are not
        fixed. These terms can not be pinned, they define a map through
        expansion and not through its framing. Leaving the edges blurry with
        possibility and potential.{" "}
