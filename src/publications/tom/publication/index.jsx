      <h2>The Letter R</h2>

      <p>
        Traveling in a car with my daughter, Cosima, we shoot the breeze and
        invent a story about cats who function as resilient storytellers in a
        post-apocalyptic world. Hortense is our heroine: She hosts salons in a
        car cemetery where many come and hope is distributed, one story at a
        time. There is no audience to <em>our</em> story other than our two
        fellow travelers, but the story contemplates its own brief lifespan:
        soon, we will arrive; soon, someone must die, and something get passed
        on (our stories often function like relays). In this case, Hortense will
        be terribly sick and another someone—her apprentice Julio, who she took
        under her wing when a kitten—will keep the fire going.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things inevitably go south. Julio, sensing the end, opens a bookstore
        dedicated to books starting with the letter “R,” a celebration of his
        life in letters made possible by Hortense’s decade-long nurturing. And
        Hortense passes, bequeathing on her death-litter the letter “R” in her
        name to Julio, her long-time confidant. And so the story ends, with a
        dead Hotense and a live and lonely JulioR, pushing open every morning
        the door of a hyper-specialized bookstore.

      <p>
        I don’t know what possesses us to give this bookshop such a ridiculously
        narrow footprint, but this amuses us no end: We both love books but tend
        to go for slightly quixotic storylines, in which concepts and inanimate
        objects regularly come to life to prop up improbable, impractical
        pursuits. The seemingly untransmissible letter “R” which Julio inherits
        is a rather cool motif: It celebrates elective kinships along a
        matrimonial model, and derails the inevitability of a given name. Now
        detached from its original owner, it is no longer tethered to her fate.
        In fact, being <em>from</em> Hortense but no longer <em>in</em> Hotense
        opens up all sorts of doors for “R”: It can be passed on and recombined,
        and may be difficult to get rid of—for surely, if you dispose of “R,”
        another just like it would take its place? Given names have a certain
        stickiness to them that always outlasts the moment of name-giving.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In this rather sacrificial framework, to <em>pass</em> something{" "}
        <em>on</em> requires a small cut in Ho(r)tense’s name, and a host, who
        will adopt and pass the letter on. It is exciting, in the context of a
        closing university program, to go a step further, and to imagine that
        letters and words have their own agency: They <em>can</em> leap out of
        pages, as Terry Pratchett often warned, and <em>that</em> is why books
        are chained shut to the library shelves in the Discworld’s Unseen
        University.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        You, dear reader, know better, and will assert your right to forget what
        you just read. Like you, I do this more and more often, for fear that a
        letter or word should stick to me that I can’t quite shake off, or
        unlearn.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>Thank you for reading this note, and good luck.</p>
