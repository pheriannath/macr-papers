        From Archive to Zombie: Crafting an Encyclopedia
      </h2>
      <p>
        In elementary school, research assignments meant turning to the set of
        cream-and-brown World Book encyclopedias in my parents living room and
        getting lost for a while. For example, if I needed to write about
        Hungary, Id dutifully flip to <em>Hungary</em> and copy down the
        population, geographical features, and gross domestic product, but then
        Id reach the part about culture and, wait, what the heck is{" "}
        <em>goulash</em>? From there, Id read about <em>paprika</em>, dive into
        the <em>spice trade</em>, hopscotch to <em>Vasco da Gama</em>, cruise
        through the section on <em>Portugal</em>, and end up looking at photos
        of <em>Iberian foxes</em>. By charting a course through multiple
        volumes, I learned the nerdy pleasures of gathering nuggets of
        knowledge, making my own tenuous associations, and feeding my curiosity.
        My school report might suffer, but these self-guided journeys felt
        exhilarating and world-expanding.

      <p>
        I havent touched a printed encyclopedia for decades; for better or
        worse, the internet has become the first place I turn to for
        information. Now, thinking of a set of instantly out-of-date books as a
        single repository of truth is inconceivable. And yet, I still think the
        encyclopedia format has its uses as a tantalizing way to induce action
        and sensation by prompting its readership to flip, skim, think, and
        wonder.
      </p>

      <h2 className="center">Structure</h2>

      <p>
        When I thought about creating a publication for my degree in Critical
        Craft Studies (MACR) that encapsulated my research and experience in the
        program, I knew I wanted to portray craft studies as always moving
        forward. My effort would contain definitions and examples but would not
        end there. Even though MACR itself is ending prematurely, what was
        made—ideas and writing and objects and connections—will remain on the
        move, weaving its way through craft discourse at large. I did not want
        to create a headstone to mark its demise, with facts and figures forever
        engraved in granite. At the same time, I was eager to utilize the
        strengths of publications—familiarity, readability, and printability—to
        communicate. How would I combine these desires to showcase specificity
        through text yet create a sense that craft studies is always evolving?
      </p>

      <p>
        An encyclopedia seemed the right format to echo the program: sometimes
        cohesive, planned, and linear, and other times spontaneous and
        experimental. Recording craft and craft-adjacent bits and pieces (that
        relate in the end, because everything does) would ensure that what was
        taught by MACR and what I got out of it is not lost. I could also
        process my complicated feelings about the end of the program through the
        publication structure, directly addressing loss through entry text or
        hinting at transformative action with the entry titles.
      </p>

      <h2 className="center">Concept</h2>

      <p>
        A good encyclopedia, like MACR, creates more questions than answers.
        Andrew Clark argues that the 18<sup>th</sup>-century{" "}
        <em>Encyclopédie</em>, helmed by Denis Diderot and created by over 100
        contributors during the Enlightenment, was always being renewed.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="indented">
        <p>
          The Encyclopédie reconfigures the idea of a compendiums signifying
          process by turning passive definitions into active or interactive
          articles whose resistance to the whole paradoxically (in the context
          of a "reference" work) requires the reader continually to question his
          relation to knowledge, closure and universal truth.
          <sup>
            <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
          </sup>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Diderots decision to hold space for his readers lets them move from
        accepting the words before them to questioning why those words were
        used. The <em>Encyclopédie</em> codifies a curated and edited point of
        view but is also a document that comes alive when entries join each
        other in conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clark believes Diderot created "a horizontal model of critique and
        interaction" by approving writing that was free to cause trouble with
        other entries or be self-reflexive. I found echoes of this approach in
        artist Sara Cwynars <em>Kitsch Encyclopedia</em>, a reflection on kitsch
        imagery that constitutes a world overlaying the real world, cleverly
        pulled from found images and the writing of Milan Kundera, Roland
        Barthes, and Jean Baudrillard. Her selections can be read or viewed at
        face value but also inspire additional movement throughout as the reader
        compares, reassesses, and questions Cwynars choices. This process makes
        a bricolage of impressions and implications; it creates, as the kids
        call it, a whole vibe. The motivating concepts behind these
        encyclopedias became the model for my own.
      </p>

      <h2 className="center">Organization</h2>

      <p>
        The <em>Encyclopedia of Craft Studies (Abridged)</em>, or ECS-A,
        includes entries that roughly follow the lines of investigation
        experienced in the program: tackling higher-level conceptual
        explorations; learning how craft objects operate in this space; and
        forming actions and reactions based on what was learned. I selected 31
        entry words to present a multiplicity of ways to think about endings and
        beginnings. Like in the <em>Encyclopédie</em>, entries orbit their topic
        at different distances, and may be literal, poetic, visual,
        autobiographical, analytical, anecdotal, or seemingly nonsensical. While
        the relationships between entries may seem inscrutable, knowing the
        rules of the game&mdash;that connections <em>might</em>{" "}
        exist&mdash;encourages the kind of critical evaluation and speculation
        that is part of MACRs pedagogy which will continue beyond the programs
        closure.
      </p>

      <h2 className="center">Connections</h2>

      <p>
        This should probably be called the{" "}
        <em>Encyclopedia of Renas Craft Studies</em>
        since I am the crucible for its contents. However, without the voices of
        those analyzing, tending to, and making craft history, this publication
        would be far less rich. I included new writing from past and present
        MACR community members, relevant reading from the syllabi, outside
        reading I discovered and enjoyed, and commissions by craft artists whose
        work addresses death and rebirth, loss, and absence.
      </p>

      <p>
        From its inception, the ECS-A was meant to be grounded in the history of
        MACR and yet contribute new meaning to the field of craft. Taken as a
        whole, it turned into a kind of self-portrait. If it generates feelings
        of sadness, outrage, surprise, glee, or confusion, then you will feel
        some of what I feel. Hopefully it is also fun to browse! Skip around the
        entries and feel free to enjoy wherever your journey takes you.
