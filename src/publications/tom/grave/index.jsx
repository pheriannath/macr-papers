        “An archivist with whom I formerly worked once said that archives are a
        type of death management work. She advised that archival repositories
        represent the documentary final resting places of a person’s lived
        experiences. Both she and Derrick [Washington] are correct, in a sense.

        Archives manage lives after death, and prisons manage lives before
        death. The political and ethical end point of this claim should be
        obvious: if archivists care as much about families and citizenship as
        much as their websites, publications, and projects profess, then they
        would begin to see the prison as the ultimate rupture of those notions
        and envision their work as seminal in contesting these graveyards of
        exclusion. Nobody belongs in prison, and it is past time for archivists
        to press the boundaries of society to make this world possible.”
