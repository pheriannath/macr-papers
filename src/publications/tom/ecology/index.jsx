        “Disturbance is a change in environmental conditions that causes a
        pronounced change in an ecosystem. Floods and fires are forms of
        disturbance; humans and other living things can also cause disturbance.
        Disturbance can renew ecologies as well as destroy them. How terrible a
        disturbance is depends on many things, including scale. Some
        disturbances are small: a tree falls in the forest, creating a light
        gap. Some are huge: a tsunami knocks open a nuclear power plant. Scales
        of time also matter: short-term damage may be followed by exuberant
        regrowth. Disturbance opens the terrain for transformative encounters,
        making new landscape assemblages possible.

        Humanists, not used to thinking with disturbance, connect the term with
        damage. But disturbance, as used by ecologists, is not always bad—and
        not always human. Human disturbance is not unique in its ability to stir
        up ecological relations. Furthermore, as a beginning, disturbance is
        always in the middle of things: the term does not refer us to a
        harmonious state before disturbance. Disturbances follow other
        disturbances. Thus all landscapes are disturbed; disturbance is
        ordinary.”
