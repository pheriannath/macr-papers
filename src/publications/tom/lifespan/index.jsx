          “One thousand trees have been planted in Nordmarka, a forest just
          outside Oslo, which will supply paper for a special anthology of books
          to be printed in one hundred years’ time. Between now and then, one
          writer every year will contribute a text, with the writings held in
          trust, unpublished, until the year 2114. Tending the forest and
          ensuring its preservation for the one-hundred-year duration of the
          artwork finds a conceptual counterpoint in the invitation extended to
          each writer: to conceive and produce a work in the hope of finding a
          receptive reader in an unknown future.”

        “The Library resurrects a rapidly receding past for the future,
        dramatically rehearsing and preserving the very silence that [Leah]
        Marcus suggests must accompany and characterize any stable preservation
        effort.

        Yet the temporalized space of the library is not simply a space of
        return, but also a space of deferral and anticipation. The Library’s
        archaic recuperation of the past is inseparable from its speculative
        projection into the future. Through the near-empty space of the Library,
        the time of the project becomes dramatically stretched beyond the
        lifespans of its initial creators: Paterson remarks, ‘[w]hen I had the
        idea for Future Library I knew instantly it would outlive me (and most
        of us alive today). It is important that I do not see it fully
        realized—it is a work conceived for an unknown, future generation.’ This
        space, then, is proleptically haunted by the future, paradoxically
        filled by both the absent presence of the books to come, and the
        gradual, inevitable disappearance of those texts’ mortal writers,
        selectors, and readers.”
