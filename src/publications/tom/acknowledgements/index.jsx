      <p>Thank yous and gratitude are due:</p>
      <p>
        To Sara Cwynar and Kim Abeles, whose work inspired me to subvert
        academic business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Indira Allegra and Kasey Smith for providing their unique
        perspectives on memory and loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        To MACR folk past and present—Sara Clugage, Miriam Devlin, Jill
        DiMassimo, Andres Payan Estrada, matt lambert, Ben Lignel, Tom Martin,
        and Namita Gupta Wiggers—for contributing their thoughts so this
        publication is abridged but not abbreviated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the whole damn 23 cohort for emotional support, <em>Chicago</em>{" "}
        style wisdom, and the after-dinner shandy ritual. And finally, to Mom
        and Dad for putting down serious cash in the 80s for a set of World Book
        encyclopedias. Ask me anything about Iberian foxes.
