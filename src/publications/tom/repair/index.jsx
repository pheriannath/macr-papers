        Repair: the craft of, a craft itself, a practice, a duty. To remediate,
        remedy, fix, or amend. A noun, a verb, the object itself, or action in
        service of an object, or some other whole made incomplete. In craft
        studies, we look at repairs as an artisanal practice, as art, as work,
        and as a reason to be crafting. As Matmos says via Rena: A Chance to Cut
        Is a Chance to Cure. To remake, reattach, rescue, darn, and mend damage,
        rot, breakages, tears, wearing, dings, frayed edges, chipped, worn,
        scratched, tattered, holey surfaces and things. Any knitting together of
        edges, or work done to return the ruptured to function or to a look.
        Made ready, to use or to be again doing again what it does, interrupted
        by rupture, returned by repair.
      </p>

      <p>
        A crafted repair is a thing itself, an entirety. Then there is the thing
        that is being repaired, returned to function or a look, but maybe not
        again made whole.
