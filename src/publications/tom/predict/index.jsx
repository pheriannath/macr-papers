      <p>
        Good evening. My name is Andres Payan Estrada. I was requested to do a
        special reading that I created. This tarot card deck was originally
        created as a way to tap into craft discourse through a more expansive
        way of thinking about craft. The intention of this tarot card deck is to
        tap into the energies of craft’s past, present, and future to seek
        guidance, or perhaps an answer, or perhaps different ways of
        understanding knowledge and ideas of a question one might have.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entire deck is designed around themes of craft. Along with this
        tarot card deck, which is the original, all hand-drawn, are objects or
        materials. Each of these objects is in connection to a craft material.
        In a typical reading, I would ask the person who we’re reading to pick
        one of these craft materials in order to channel this reading and seek
        guidance from the craft divine. In the case of this special reading,
        we’re going to use all of the craft materials and channel through all of
        that multiplicity of possibilities to seek an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this alignment are a few objects that I’ll run through very quickly.
        This is a collection of scraps of cardboard. This cardboard comes from
        boxes that have moved goods and objects from around the world. The next
        one is copper in raw form, in connection to the minerals and the
        materials we extract from Earth and that we often place value into. The
        next one is drift bark, in connection to wood. This drift bark comes
        from the northern coast of California, with connections to the tallest
        and oldest trees in the world. The next one is raw wool. It is an
        organic wool in connection to the care that we put into living beings in
        order to carefully and kindly extract resources and materials that we
        will use, perhaps in our daily lives or in our practice. The next one is
        unfired raw clay from California, in connection to the Earth, but also
        in connection to the possibility of transformation. The next one is
        iron, meteorite from Argentina. A lot of the materials that make up this
        object actually pre-date a lot of the materials we find on Earth. The
        next one is obsidian, in connection to glass and glassmaking. It’s a
        naturally occurring material that has connections to rituals, to
        spirituality, and this one comes from central Mexico. It also has deep
        connections to indigenous histories. The next one is an igneous rock
        from the Mojave region. It’s a lava rock. It has connections to heat and
        transformation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the reading will be a past, present, future reading. We’re going
        to ask about the Warren Wilson College MA in Critical Craft Studies.
        Perhaps it will give us guidance into the present, or perhaps into the
        future, of this program. Or maybe what will come from the cards is a
        reevaluation of the past. We will seek past, present, and future [by]
        reading three cards. [For] the last card, we’ll have a double reading
        where we’ll place a fourth card on top, to really project into the
        future. I’m gonna shuffle the deck one more time. Since this reading is
        being done virtually, my hand will cut the deck. As I’m doing this,
        perhaps think about your question to what is your craft future, what is
        your craft past, what do you want to carry on, doesn’t need to change,
        doesn’t need to evolve. Do you need to reconcile something, an idea, an
        individual, a project that has been left behind that you need to carry
        on into the future? [We] split the cards into three at the center, where
        we start.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah, a yellow card. Interesting. This deck of cards consists of a major
        arcana and a minor arcana, which has four different sets of cards. Each
        one of these has a different connection to craft. The major arcana has
        connections to broader, more abstract ways of thinking. The minor arcana
        is divided into four sets—a yellow set, which has a connection to craft
        tools, a green set that has a connection to community, an orange set
        that has a connection to craft objects, and a blue set that has a
        connection to craft materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ll start our reading with this card into the past, the hammers. This
        card is part of the craft tools. There’s eight hammers. As we think
        about the past and eight hammers, it means that the possibility was
        presented to create something or do something. In the past was eight
        hammers, which means that many different paths, and many different ways
        of achieving something, were presented. The task at hand was which of
        these tools is the one you must use. As makers, we understand that the
        hammer is [a very simple tool], but the reality is each hammer is
        designed for a very specific purpose. The task is not how to use the
        tool, but which is the one you need to pick to [do] the job. Don’t be
        overwhelmed by the possibilities. Instead, focus on the task to find the
        tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, the present, the raw gemstone. The raw gemstone has a connection to
        the minor arcana, in particular with craft materials. The raw gemstone
        in the present is a valuable lesson, one that has to do with valuing
        things. The reality of the raw gemstone is that the raw gemstone already
        inherently has value. You do not need to cut it or polish it, but you
        need to acknowledge the value of something is there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now into the future. The statement necklace, hmm, interesting. The
        statement necklace has a connection to craft objects. The statement
        necklace is in the future. The statement necklace is that last thing you
        put onto your outfit to complete the look. But the statement necklace
        also forms a connection with other individuals, perhaps [as] an
        icebreaker or something to start a conversation about. But here it’s
        reversed, the statement necklace isn’t there yet. One more thing needs
        to come into this conversation, this idea, this project, to add that one
        last thing that will help close the deal for that outfit. Now, reminder,
        the statement necklace also has a connection to being an icebreaker. So
        that statement necklace must be there in order to create conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        One more card will go on our future. This is a pink card, which has a
        connection with the major arcana. The residency. The card of the
        residency is an important one in this deck. It almost has a counterpart,
        the studio. The residency has to do with mobility, with going somewhere
        else in order to get something done. Because a lot of times some things
        need to be done outside of the studio. The residency also has a
        connection to a community, building a new community and peers who you
        can be in conversation with, often outside the insularity of the studio.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we read through the entire reading, we’ll acknowledge that many
        opportunities were presented in the past, and that one had to pick the
        right tool to do the job at hand. In the present, we have raw gemstone,
        reiterating that value comes from within, that you don’t have to
        overwork something to acknowledge there’s value in it. The raw gemstone
        could be polished, it could be cut, it could be presented as something
        even more beautiful. But the reality is that it’s already beautiful as
        it is. As we go into the future, we’re given a task by the cards, one of
        them the statement necklace, to find that last component that will
        finish that outfit for you, that’s going to bring things together. That
        last component will bring everything together within, but at the same
        time allows oneself to open up to a conversation with others. And
        lastly, the residency, connection to mobility, acknowledging that not
        everything that you have to accomplish has to happen within the walls of
        your studio. Sometimes you have to go outside [it] to open up to other
        individuals, to have different conversations, and to develop new
        projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this resonates with everyone. It certainly has resonated with me.
        Thank you all for watching this reading. Have a good day, evening,
        afternoon, whatever it is, time is [irrelevant] when the past, the
        present, and the future collapse into each other.
