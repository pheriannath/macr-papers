        Everything that exists exists as it exists <em>for you</em>. You are
        making coffee in your kitchen; this is your coffee, in your mug, in your
        hand, in your house. Everything shows up as it shows up because it is
        you for whom it is showing up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          This showing up is not just the thing overlaid with <em>yoursness</em>
          —rather,
        </em>
        things are what they are because you are you. Were there no hand, there
        would be no mug as such, as it is the hand that calls for the handle of
        the mug. Simple. More complex, were there no body to be affected, there
        would be no coffee (<em>as such</em>) because there would be no brain to
        be affected, stimulated, primed. There may be hot brown water, but it is
        you that makes it coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next: Everything is like this, all the way down, always. Hot brown
        water? Well, it is only “hot” because we have a body to be burnt, or we
        have organs to keep warm. It is not hot from the perspective of a
        thermophilic bacterium, for whom it might be deadly cold. Brown? No such
        thing beyond the shared attunements of the human eye to the properties
        of light. <em>Even “water”?</em> You betcha. Steam is water, ice is
        water, much of air is water, but we never encounter these as water
        because we cannot carry them across our skin, through our blood, out our
        kidneys. Ontology starts and ends in the body.

        Speculate: What is being beyond the being we can know? What are the
        objects known to a black hole?

        What is a tool without a human hand?

        What energies enliven things as they bump around amongst themselves, out
        of human sight?
