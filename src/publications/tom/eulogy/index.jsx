      <p className="question">What is craft studies?</p>
      <p>
        I’ve been asked this countless times since I started grad school. “What
        are you studying? … Um … so you’re learning how to make things?”
      </p>

      <p>
        And then I fumble around for some way to explain. In my more cynical
        moments, this misconception feels like a contributing factor to why the
        program is going away. It’s frustrating.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Okay, but seriously, what is it? And why the eulogy? Is it really dead?
      </p>
      <p>
        The MA program in Critical Craft Studies, or MACR for short, is a
        low-residency master’s program at Warren Wilson College. The program is
        ending in 2023. The discipline of craft studies is not ending. It’s a
        cliché to say it will live on through others, but clichés are born from
        some amount of truth.
      </p>

      <p className="question">Let’s try this again. What are you studying?</p>
      <p>
        Craft history, theory, and practice. Making, unmaking, remaking.
        Intention and manifestation. Happenstance and culmination. The tangible
        and intangible. The special and the everyday. Relationships between
        people, places, and things.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        That encompasses a lot, so why is it important to define craft studies
        as its own field?
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s true that craft is confusingly broad and narrow. Even though it
        integrates with disciplines like art history, sociology, anthropology,
        archaeology, material studies, and decorative arts, it’s a different
        animal. In craft, I see a stubbornness on the part of the people who
        make and use things, whether deliberately or instinctively, and a need
        to show that skills and bodies matter. This is something craft studies
        scholars and thinkers amplify, and the loss of MACR’s voice will impact
        this work.
      </p>

      <p className="question">How do you feel right now?</p>
      <p>
        Thanks to my instructors and mentors, the reading and research, and a
        variety of memes sent around by my cohort, I daily experience frequency
        bias in a big way—it’s craft all the way down. I am exhausted by the
        endless amount of thinking and writing. I’m tired of dreaming about
        forgotten citations. I miss making with my hands myself. And I’m sick of
        trying to explain what I do.
      </p>

      <p>
        On top of this, the program is shutting down while it’s just warming up.
        Craft often needs to fight for itself, however, and has always played
        the long game. Contemplating the end of the program is upsetting, but
        craft studies remains. Like little birds, MACR students have ingested
        the tasty seeds of craft knowledge which will be carried throughout the
        world and take root.
