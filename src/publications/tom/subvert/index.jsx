        The dictionary definition of “subvert” is “to try to destroy or damage
        something, especially an established political system.”

        This is a huge and complex goal to tackle. How can craft participate?
      </p>

      <p>
        Even at the individual level, craft is a wonderful vehicle for a person
        to find tiny victories where they can, pushing against the norms that
        dismiss or devalue its contributions. This may mean cross-stitching
        “Fresh Out of Fucks” to provide a self-determined alternative to
        traditional domesticity, or executing visible mending to reveal
        invisible labor in defiance of capitalist culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The phrase “subvert the dominant paradigm” has origins in the theory of
        paradigm shift proposed by Thomas Kuhn in his 1962 book,{" "}
        <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>; the book itself is
        responsible for subverting an existing way of thinking. A paradigm shift
        occurs when accumulated knowledge, hardened by testing and widely
        accepted as canon, fails when it is confronted and tested by something
        entirely new. After the system crumbles, there is anger and resistance
        to the new irrefutable information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Craft is many things: a dialogue between maker and material, a
        connection to our past, and a potent bearer of symbolic meaning. It has
        been used to perpetuate harm in the name of imperialism, racism, and
        capitalism (to name only a few) but can be wielded to resist these same
        forces. It subverts by its very existence, cannily taking on the
        dominant paradigm, exposing flaws and demanding change. Considered a
        feminine or marginalized activity, its misunderstood nature can work in
        its favor. As once-ignored collective evidence becomes exposed to the
        light, a demonstration of craft’s relevance can upend systems of power
        and point to ways to recast the future.
