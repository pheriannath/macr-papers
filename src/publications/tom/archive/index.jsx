      <h2>Teaching to Witness: An Attempt at Exhausting Archives</h2>
      <p>
        Working in craft museums and academia illuminates the precarity of
        archives and the limits of what is or is not available within archives.
        A slew of questions run through my head:
      </p>

      <p>
        What is an archive? Where are archives? What kinds of archives can
        students access? Who is present in archives? Who is absent? Who has been
        deliberately absented? How do we teach students to build archives when
        the ones needed to preserve craft histories don’t exist?
      </p>

      <p>
        What follows are incomplete thoughts about archives connected to my work
        as the former chief curator and director, Museum of Contemporary Craft,
        Portland, Oregon, and soon-to-be-former founding director, MA in
        Critical Craft Studies. In anticipation of writing an essay …

        Upon arrival on my first day as the first curator at the museum, I am
        shown the “auxiliary storage,” where the storage of wood furniture by
        Sam Maloof and John Economaki has rendered a bathroom unusable. Stacks
        of rolled textiles are professionally sandwiched between
        archival-paper-covered tubes and hand-labeled archival linen bags in
        “special storage”; I wonder if “special” refers to the vines creeping in
        from outside.

        Six file cabinets with four drawers each line a wall. One houses all
        archives from 1937 to 1990. Volunteers, several of whom helped catalogue
        the archive and collections, share that a short-term director disposed
        of drawers of files she thought were unnecessary to keep, and all that
        remains are things that Darcy Edgar, the former registrar, could reach
        and rescue from the Dumpster.

        hands me two brown paper grocery bags filled with different kinds of

        Wildenhain, photographs from his two summer workshops at Pond Farm, and

        We gather and scan hundreds of slides and photographs gathered from
        family, friends, museums, publications, and newspaper articles to map
        her work through the years. This is curatorial work: building an archive
        in order to identify when an artist made something. Curatorial
        departments so often make archives that are never made public—they are
        there to support another curatorial purpose. Building this archive
        consumed nearly a full semester of one intern’s work. This archive is
        uploaded to the museum server but cannot be made public because we do
        not have permission from collectors and museums, nor funds to create,

          How do archives designed to document and preserve art history serve or
          fail craft histories? Alternative databases structured to serve the
          ceramics field, such as AccessCeramics and Artaxis, reveal limitations
          in popular artwork databases as well as limitations of categories and
          information architecture that does not accommodate specificities of
          craft media, processes, and objects. Social media projects such as
          Pots in Action, on Instagram, continue to develop into alternative
          archives; here, ceramic artists mine and share historic and
          contemporary photographs and videos grouped by hashtags, not canonical
          structures based on authorship and names or works grouped into
          movements. Mining exhibition archives in museums of all sizes and
          types reveals histories of craft that defy stereotypes of invisibility
          of craft in art history. How, for example, can strategies to mine such
          archives—limited as the existing ephemera may be—become shared
          teaching resources for art historians and artists of future
          generations?

        narratives, and the importance of a critical lens to understand why a
        photocopied poster might be a critically vital historical document. It

        As MACR prepared for the first residency in 2018, conversations with
        incoming students revealed that a number of them did not have working
        experience conducting research in archives. I connected with resources
        in the Swannanoa/Asheville area to serve as laboratories for experience
        and to build familiarity with different types of archives for their own
        research. The array of local archives opened categories and questions:
        regional archives and repairing community trust; archives as support for
        organizational, college, and museum missions; research resulting from
        engagement with archives; learning through materials with Indigenous
        elders; living history spaces as archives of history; and competition
        amongst archives to be <em>the</em> place for research on Black Mountain
        College. Students applied what they experienced and learned to archive
        where their feet hit the ground. Discussions of what constitutes an
        archive expanded where to look for craft—libraries, homes, community
        centers, oral histories, etc.

        In year two (2019), first-year students were told on a tour at Southern
        Highland Craft Guild that there were no Black craftspeople in North
        Carolina. I was not on the trip; the experience was revisited the next
        day with the students and core and workshop faculty. The experience
        provoked ongoing research projects, program revisions, and discussions
        about how to represent what has <em>not</em> been archived. One
        student’s Practicum project and an alumni’s grant-supported research
        project developed from this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second-year students were ready to put archival research into public
        view. I wanted students to feel the agency I felt in working side by
        side with people contributing to accessible public knowledge during Art
        & Feminism Wikipedia events. Sara Clugage, Art & Feminism coordinator,
        connected students to working on Wikipedia by using research files on
        the studio craft movement donated by Tara Leigh Tappert to the Warren
        Wilson College archives through her first and ongoing Wikipedia
        workshops.

        I read the book, call her directly, and fan girl. She agrees that

        the program but connects me with others who work on craft-related
        topics.{" "}

      <p>
        The world shut down because of the pandemic. All research had to be
        conducted online. Students could not access archives, libraries,
        museums, their local friends and family, or each other. Even Heather
        South’s brilliant energy and passion for storytelling through archives
        barely broke through the Zoom barrier; objects she shared prompted a
        paper by one student. Warren Wilson College let their archivist go;
        there was no access available to research craft history.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Place-based learning could not happen through modelling at WWC or in
        people’s own places.
      </p>

      <p>
        To work around this problem, I encouraged students to work with digital
        archives, and to think of Ravelry as an archive.

        residency.{" "}

      <p>
        Tiffany expands faculty knowledge; she can teach the students how to
        connect physical archives and digital public platforms, to connect
        pieces of knowledge that are in plain sight—newspaper clippings,
        mercantile records, historical narratives—in ways that restore human
        beings into history. She researches craft histories and teaches how
        questions—and looking—can lead to change. Assigning Coolie Woman: The
        Odyssey of Indenture, by Gaiutra Bahadur, as a model of writing history
        when colonial powers have erased records works as an example of a
        finished project; Tiffany teaches students to do the research itself.
