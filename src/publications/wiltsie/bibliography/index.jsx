        One of the aspects of the MACR program that will stick with me in my
        professional life moving forward is the value of sharing resources. For
        a researcher, bibliographies are a vital way of demonstrating the depth
        of your inquiry, situating yourself in the scholarly conversation, and
        giving due credit to those who came before you and contributed to your
        thought process. An equally important, but less often discussed,
        function of the bibliography is that it is an act of care and service to
        others: providing a roadmap for your current colleagues and future
        researchers so that the conversation can continue to move forward.

        Over the course of its short existence, the Warren Wilson MACR program
        has cultivated this community of generosity with knowledge. Students are
        constantly sharing resources with each other, passing along leads for
        everything from an Instagram post to a journal article that reminded
        them of someone’s research interests. This practice was actively
        incorporated into the curriculum as well, and students in the 2023
        cohort collectively contributed to a shared Zotero database of
        craft-related resources. With this in mind, it feels only fitting to
        conclude this small collection of materials with a short selection of
        future readings and related sources. Some are directly connected to
        other sections of this publication, while others have been gathered from
        previous course syllabi or suggested by others, but each one contributes
        to the conversation in a different way.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my annotations, I have attempted to elucidate my thought process and
        how each particular resource supported me in my own research journey,
        while also offering a point of entry for others to find their next
        direction. It could be said that by nature all research is fluid and
        ever-changing, but I have found over the past two years in this program
        that craft research—as a relatively new, dynamic, and interdisciplinary
        field—is especially so, and it is on all of us to keep the conversation
        growing. The title of this section, “Gathering Raw Materials,” alludes
        to the various chemical components (such as kaolin, bentonite, cobalt,
        or iron) used in developing ceramic clay bodies, glazes, and pigments.
        The following sources are meant to serve as ingredients in much the same
        way, to be combined into something new. And so, I invite you to take
        what you wish from each of them and discover for yourself where the next
        path will lead.

        In lieu of the more conventional academic practice of ordering
        bibliographies alphabetically, I have chosen to offer this list in an
        order that approximately aligns with the order in which I encountered
        them as my research process unfolded. Some of the annotations allude to
        this context of discovery as I point to the people who led me to that
        particular text.{" "}

            Although the trajectories of both this publication and my Practicum
            paper took me farther and farther away from the setting of early
            modern Japanese craft, it would be remiss of me not to include this
            book by renowned scholar of Japanese art history, Christine Guth. I
            mention in my image gallery caption for the Nabeshima porcelain{" "}
            <em>Plate with Three Jars</em> that my whole journey down this path
            of self-referential craft began with that object, and this book is
            where I first encountered that photograph (on page 102). The chapter
            that this plate appears in, “Picturing the Early Modern Craftscape,”
            also has a particular relevance to the ideas of depiction and
            learning from representations of craft that <em>Pots on Pots</em>{" "}
            attempts to bring forth. The use of the word “craftscape” in the
            chapter title also has an unexpected connection to this
            publication’s secondary function of documenting a research process
            and approaches to craft scholarship that I learned in the MACR
            program, as the term craftscape was coined by the program’s founding
            director, Namita Gupta Wiggers.

            Meghen Jones was my mentor for the 2021 spring semester and was the
            first to introduce me to W. J. T. Mitchell’s metapictures theory.
            Her dissertation here on the work of postwar Japanese potter
            Tomimoto Kenkichi touches on a historical example of an artist
            depicting the vessel form (very often his own work) on the ceramic
            surface, which Jones refers to as Tomimoto’s “metaceramics.” She
            also addresses Tomimoto’s apparent fascination with depicting the
            vessel form both through his drawings on paper and simple brush
            paintings on a flat ceramic tile. Due to copyright restrictions, I
            was unable to include Tomimoto’s work in the image gallery, but
            Jones connects Chinese- and Japanese-made historical works, such as
            the plates shown in the gallery that contain the “flower basket”
            motif, as likely influences that Tomimoto would have been exposed
            to.

            I’ve chosen to include only one annotation for both of these two
            books by W. J. T. Mitchell, who is featured in the interview in the
            first section of <em>Pots on Pots</em>. Mitchell was a significant
            influence for me over the course of this research process, and these
            two books, starting with the essay “Metapictures” in{" "}
            <em>Picture Theory</em>, provided me with a theoretical framework to
            begin my exploration into “metacraft,” which ultimately led me to
            pots on pots. In his interview, Mitchell offers great insight into
            his research trajectory and the development of the concepts that he
            proposes, so if that piece resonated with you, I highly recommend
            spending some quality time with this material.

            Although this book has a somewhat narrow historical focus of early
            modern Chinese porcelain, ceramics historian Jonathan Hay uses it to
            offer readers a broadly applicable strategy for evaluating the
            surface decoration found on ceramic objects. His description of
            craft as an object that “thinks with us” is reminiscent of
            Mitchell’s personification of the picture, while his articulation of
            the object’s “surfacescape” as a feature of craft worthy of deep
            analysis provides a useful foundation for the application of image
            theory to craft discourse. This is another resource that Meghen
            Jones led me to in the course of my initial inquiry into
            conceptualizing “metacraft” objects.

            <em>Global Objects</em> was perhaps one of the most influential
            books for me throughout my two years in the MACR program. Rather
            than offering a chronological or geographical historical narrative,
            Cooke presents stories of craft and material culture through
            thematic categories, such as “Circulation and Exchange,” “Memory and
            Gift,” and “Appearance,” that demonstrate the movement,
            transmission, and evolution of technique, material, technology,
            imagery, and style as craft objects move through the world. This
            interchange and change of visual culture can be seen in the multiple
            expressions of the same “flower basket” motif on objects in the
            image gallery. Molly Hatch also addresses these global connections
            in her work and spoke during the artist panel about her interest in
            the adaptation of form and decoration throughout ceramics history,
            especially in the influences of Chinese-made ceramics that were
            exported.

            While the texts in the preceding entries shaped my initial
            investigation into the research topic of Pots on Pots, this text was
            the first one that I encountered in the process of developing the
            publication itself, as we were prompted to look toward the program
            archives as potential source material. MACR students participated in
            a workshop with author Anna Fariello during the July 2019 residency,
            and this chapter was one of the preparatory readings for that class.
            In this introduction, Fariello provides an overview of the role that
            craft objects have played in relation to both art history and
            anthropology. In the context of metacraft, reading about the study
            of objects in this way prepares us not only for evaluation of the
            cultural value of objects themselves, but also provides insight into
            what we can learn from the secondary craft objects that are
            represented on the surface of those objects.

            <br />
            This book chapter by archeologist Jenifer Neils analyzes a number of
            ancient Greek vases that depict the image of vases. She speculates
            about the use of the painted vases as a strategy for advertising and
            a form of recording labor, and also discusses the cultural
            importance of various specific vessel forms in ritual use. The
            archeological approach also offers a space for visual analysis in
            identifying precisely the type of pottery that is being depicted and
            what symbolism those vessels might imply. This essay can also help
            contextualize some of the work in the image gallery, where we see
            ancient pottery much like the ones that Neils discusses alongside
            contemporary work that pays homage to ceramic history through the
            depiction of these historical ceramic forms.

            Fredericton, New Brunswick: Goose Lane Editions, 2021. <br />
            <br />
            This exhibition catalog was published alongside Canadian ceramicist
            Walter Ostrom’s retrospective exhibition. As Mariko Paterson
            mentioned in the artist panel discussion, Ostrom, who was a
            professor at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design for many years,
            is “a big ‘pot on pot’ person,” and his influences “trickled” down
            to her through an educational lineage of Ostrom’s students who then
            became her teachers. I was not aware of Ostrom’s work until that
            interview and was thrilled to discover this book when I searched for
            further information on him shortly afterward. Of particular interest
            in the catalog are Ray Cronin’s essay, “History as Content/Tradition
            as Idea,” on Ostrom’s practice of combining various cultural and
            historical ceramic forms both in and on his work, and Ursula
            Hargens’s essay, “What You See Is Not What You Get,” where she
            writes about Ostrom’s work, <em>Dutch Treat Plate</em>, which is
            featured in the image gallery section of <em>Pots on Pots</em>,
            calling his interpretations of historical ceramic forms a
            “remarkable connection between potters [that] creates conversations
            that extend over centuries and beyond a maker’s lifetime” (page 62).
