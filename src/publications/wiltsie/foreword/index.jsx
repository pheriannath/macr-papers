        The original title for this project was <em>Craft on Craft</em>, and it
        was created with the intent of investigating the decorative phenomenon
        in which the representation of a craft object is depicted on the surface
        of another craft object, a topic that I have been working with in my
        Practicum project research using the term “metacraft,” in reference to
        W. J. T. Mitchell’s essay on what he calls “metapictures.”

        As the publication evolved, however, and each component began to take
        form, a stronger narrative emerged of a material-specific trend in
        ceramic surface decoration. Although ceramics is by no means the only
        craft category that employs self-referential imagery, I could not ignore
        that the overwhelming majority of the examples that I encountered shared
        this common medium, and thus decided to shift the focus of the project
        to what you see here, retitled as <em>Pots on Pots</em>.

        As I reflect back on the MA in Critical Craft Studies program, I am
        struck by how deeply my work has been impacted by the
        interdisciplinarity of the curriculum as we try to shape the developing
        field of Craft Studies. In our coursework, residency sessions, and
        independently driven research, students are encouraged to reach across
        boundaries between academic fields and to look at objects and history
        from unconventional angles, identifying connections that may not yet
        have been acknowledged in current scholarship and opening up
        conversations to collaboratively work through new ideas. When I set out
        to produce this publication, I wanted to put this practice into action
        to engage an aspect of craft that has captivated me for the past year. I
        also envisioned a theoretical sidebar to my Practicum project research:
        a “sandbox project” where I could have the freedom to play and explore
        the topic, with each item providing a thinking space to work through the
        idea from a different angle.

        Over the course of the year, both my Practicum and this publication
        changed significantly, as one continued to inform the other. The
        resulting publication presented here is simultaneously a documentation
        of this research process, a collection of ideas and conversations around
        a specific craft topic, and an exploration of different approaches to
        craft scholarship, memorializing the skills that the MACR program has
        taught us. To dig into the theoretical side of this conversation, I
        interviewed visual theorist W. J. T. Mitchell, asking him to revisit his
        influential metapictures theory and discuss the possible implications of
        applying his theory of “nested representation” in two-dimensional images
        to three-dimensional craft objects that contain an image of themselves
        or other craft objects. I also conducted a wide search of both
        historical and contemporary examples of this craft phenomenon, resulting
        in an image gallery that shows the commonalities that can be found
        across time and geography, showcasing the visual connections that result
        from object-based craft research. From this search, I invited three
        contemporary ceramic artists—Molly Hatch, Mariko Paterson, and Kevin
        McNamee-Tweed—to gather on Zoom for a moderated panel discussion,
        highlighting the importance of recording the first-hand knowledge of
        craft makers. In this conversation, these three artists came together to
        discuss their working processes and share insight about materiality,
        representation, and ceramic history.{" "}

        In the MACR program, we often discuss the importance of situating
        ourselves in the larger scholarly conversation and the collaborative
        nature of the ever-changing field of Craft Studies. Therefore, I have
        chosen to conclude <em>Pots on Pots</em> with an invitation for further
        research and exploration, in the form of an annotated list of suggested
        resources and readings, some of which have been gathered from course
        syllabi or suggested by program faculty. The goal of this project is not
        to articulate a definitive new theory, but rather to illustrate the
        value of studying this category of craft objects and ask questions about
        why we make and enjoy this visual decorative strategy, all the while
        reflecting back on a research process to illustrate the unexpected
        connections that can emerge when you allow the conversation to unfold.
