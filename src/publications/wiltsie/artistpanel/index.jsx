        As craft researchers, we often are forced to speculate about the makers
        of the objects that we study, which can at many times prove frustrating
        because questions remain unanswered. As I wondered about the motivations
        and inspirations of craftspeople working hundreds of years ago for my
        Practicum, I knew that I had an important opportunity with this project
        to reach out to contemporary craft artists and spotlight them in the
        conversation. Going to the source and recording the lived experience of
        craftspeople in their own voices is a hugely important part of craft
        research, and often brings unexpected insights and connections to light.
        I chose the format of a moderated group discussion rather than
        individual interviews or commissioned essays because I wanted to bring
        people together and create space to bounce ideas off of one another to
        celebrate this niche sector of craft work. The three artists who joined
        me—Mariko Paterson, Molly Hatch, and Kevin McNamee-Tweed—all work in
        ceramics and utilize the image of the vessel and other clay objects as a
        central feature in their conceptual approach to their work.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the common threads that came out of the discussion is the value
        of connecting to material culture history, understanding one’s lineage
        as a ceramicist, and situating the work within that history. Hatch,
        especially, speaks of her work giving new context to pieces in museums,
        offering viewers a more approachable entry point to learn about ceramics
        history and decorative styles. This perspective helped shift my thinking
        in my Practicum work as I began to see the value of interpreting the
        imagery on craft objects as historical documents that can offer us
        records of material culture over time. Each of the artists also
        emphasized the importance of drawing attention to the materiality of the
        work, bringing the presence of the clay to the content of the surface
        imagery while also blurring boundaries between drawing/painting and
        ceramics by developing unique expressive styles in visual depiction.
        McNamee-Tweed, for example, primarily works in flat slabs that hang on
        the wall, inscribing his “drawings” into the clay surface, while
        Paterson uses a layered collage of hand painting and applied decals on
        the surfaces of her large vessels. The nature of ceramic surface
        decoration that leads to this interplay between pictorial representation
        and material form points to a possible explanation of why the visual
        phenomenon of depicting craft objects appears to be so much more
        prevalent in ceramics than in other craft media.{" "}

        <span className="speaker">Tina Wiltsie:</span> Thank you all for joining
        me today; I’m so excited to be having this chat with you. I’ve been
        working on this topic of meta representation on craft objects from
        multiple different angles for a while now and have admired each of your
        work so I am really looking forward to this chance to meet you all and
        talk to you together. I’d like to start off by asking each of you to
        give a brief introduction of yourself and a bit about the type of work
        you do.

        born in Vancouver, but then went to a small community college there in
        Langara, and then I ended up in Alberta, going to school here, and then
        started an illustrious MFA journey to Kent State, in Ohio. After that, I
        started working in New York, Greenwich House Pottery … I taught at
        University of Michigan for a year. I’ve taught in quite a few places in
        the US and Canada, and have done residencies and such, then ended up in
        Halifax on the east coast of Canada, and then back here after the
        pandemic. So I’ve just resumed my own practice. I have the
        bread-and-butter section, which is making a lot of mugs and things which
        happen in the background, but then I make bigger, bigger, bigger
        functional historically based pieces, more involved pieces that sell
        for—not millions of dollars, of course, but they make their way up in
        the world. So Calgary is my home again now.

        McNamee-Tweed. I am somehow in North Carolina, which is where I was
        raised, but was in many other places … went to undergrad in New York,
        and then spent seven or so years in Austin, Texas, where I stumbled into
        working at an arts organization and started wearing many hats: curator,
        managing studios, developing public-facing programming, and I started
        feeding my own practice more and more through what I was learning as I
        did that. Then at some point, my own work overtook all bandwidth. I went
        to get an MFA in Iowa, met my wife, who’s from Spain and is a writer,
        and we moved to North Carolina in a sort of post-pandemic
        fever-decision-making moment, which has been great. She teaches at UNC
        now and we have a 14-month-old baby … and here we are, making it work.

        <span className="speaker">Molly Hatch:</span> I’m Molly Hatch, I grew up
        in Vermont and moved to Boston for art school. I only applied to one art
        school—the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University. At
        that time, they were separate schools, but the Museum School was
        accredited by its relationship with Tufts University. I was very
        interested in the rigorous academic offerings of Tufts University, and
        that proved to be worthwhile. I took five years between undergrad and
        grad school to work as a studio potter … traveled, did some residencies,
        got married, tried my hand at showing work. I stayed in the Boston area
        for a bit, and then went to graduate school at the University of
        Colorado from 2005 to 2008 to earn my master’s in ceramics. I thought I
        was going to go on to be a professor—and I did go on to be a
        professor—but it really ended up being less of a concentration of my
        time than I had expected. Really, I think the ultimate reason I went to
        graduate school is because I figured out that I couldn’t see a future
        for myself as a studio potter. I decided that I had more things to work
        on than that and I needed to figure out alternatives to making a living
        as a studio potter.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I graduated with my MFA, it was 2008 and there were only two
        teaching jobs available, so I was sure I wasn’t going to get a teaching
        job that year, but I was able to get a teaching job at Dartmouth
        College—they have a non-academic program and I had attended the school
        there, and was local to that area. Not long after, my husband and I
        decided to move to the Northampton, Massachusetts, area (which is where
        we still live) and pretty quickly I found work teaching at a local
        community college and was making work for a show at The Clay Studio [in
        Philadelphia] … and gallery representation came out of that. Leslie
        Ferrin represented my work from that show forward—the show at The Clay
        Studio. A few years later, I shifted to being represented by Todd
        Merrill, in New York. I taught at RISD for a little bit, and about six
        or seven years ago I stopped teaching altogether, and was balancing a
        career of designing for industry (design work also came out of that show
        at The Clay Studio), and developing gallery work. About three years ago,
        I put down all design work and I’ve been concentrating fully on gallery
        work only. So that’s where I am in my career.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Thank you all so much for sharing
        those journeys with us. I always love hearing everyone’s stories because
        they’re all so nonlinear, but I usually find that we all end up wherever
        we’re supposed to be. I’ve also taken the long way around, so to speak,
        and do have a studio background as well, but now of course I’m here in
        the MACR program at Warren Wilson and leaning fully into craft research
        and writing. It’s been an adventure, and I’m so happy that now I have
        the opportunity to have these kinds of conversations with artists like
        you and really dig deeper into so many fields that impact this work.

        I actually find it interesting that all three of you here for this panel
        discussion are ceramic artists because, so far, for this project, I’ve
        been looking more broadly at craft media and didn’t intend to restrict
        it to ceramics. Right now, I’m thinking a lot about ideas of
        representation and depiction, and I’ve just become so fascinated with
        this idea of the image of the thing on the surface of the thing. And the
        overwhelming majority of pieces that I’ve found have been ceramic work,
        so I’m starting to think that there’s something there about ceramics,
        specifically, that contributes to it. I’ve asked the three of you here
        because you each engage with depicting ceramics and other craft objects
        in your work, but you all do it in different ways, both technically and
        stylistically. I’d love to hear from each of you next about how you
        arrived at your particular form of surface decoration, and maybe why you
        chose to work with the imagery that you do.

        <span className="speaker">KMT:</span> The way that I ended up in an art
        context was super circuitous and sort of arbitrary, and the way that I
        ended up in a ceramic practice is just as circuitous and arbitrary. I
        think I’m mostly concerned with image making. At some point, I was
        handed a piece of clay and picked up a pen that was next to me, and
        smushed it, then drew in it … and it presented itself as a pretty
        compelling way to make images. After years of experimenting and learning
        about the immensity of what it means to have any sort of control over
        this medium—from wet clay, through working with it, to bisquing, and
        then glazing, and all the different firing techniques—it has now,
        weirdly, become very much the center of what I do. They’re referred to
        as ceramic paintings, and they definitely are operating as paintings.
        They function in the context of the history of painting: they hang on a
        wall, they’re flat, but as I learned how to make stuff and reckon with
        the processes that are involved, I became increasingly interested in the
        histories. Having not been trained at all in it, I had to sort of seek
        it out. I would stumble onto some technique, thinking I’d come up with
        something, but if I show it to someone that has a BFA in ceramics, they
        know that this technique has been around for millennia. So I’ve had
        many, many, moments like that, and have gotten into ceramics beyond what
        I make with clay and glaze. I make vessels now, too, and I think if you
        play with clay enough, you end up making something that holds something.
        If you’re just bored and you don’t know what you’re doing, you end up
        making a bowl almost every time, and then you sort of accidentally
        develop skill over time.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        So now I’m at a place where I’m making work with a lot of different
        ceramic methodologies and accepting this nomenclature of being a ceramic
        artist, if anyone cares to make such distinctions. One of the questions
        was, what about this idea of the representation of vessels, right? I
        think, like anything, it’s just something that happens. There’s no
        design or “the moment,” but at some point I just drew the outline of a
        vase form and then the imagery that happened inside of it, and I
        thought, “oh, that does something.” Then you fine tune that and realize
        what’s happening within that formula. For me, it does add this extra
        “meta” dimension where you’re alerted to the fact that you’re looking
        through something. You know it’s a frame, and the frame then becomes
        this window, a vase-shaped window. Then it also is a nod to this
        material history. The other place where this consideration of ceramic
        form and the history of vessels happens is in these rooms and interiors
        depicted with accumulating objects, accumulation spaces. A lot of times
        they’re vaguely like a studio, or maybe a kitchen or something, and
        they’re kind of these stages for placing things that I’m thinking about
        or experimenting with. I like them because they allow me to perform what
        I think is the really basic function of what I do. Making art is often
        just about, “Oh, I love that, I love looking at that!” And that’s why I
        make stuff, I want to just keep looking. I like to make things from that
        space out of a love for looking at something and trying to pivot off of
        it. So these sort of accumulation interiors full of objects are, for me,
        like constellations of things that I’m thinking about, a place to put
        that research.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> I love that idea of the
        accumulation space, both as a way to explore your ideas and also as a
        reflection of all of these objects that we surround ourselves with in
        our lives. In a lot of your work, you show them as a flattened image—as
        you said, they function like paintings—but it’s using the same medium,
        and the reference to that materiality is so interesting to me, so thank
        you for sharing that. Mariko or Molly, do you want to go next?

        <span className="speaker">MP:</span> Sure, I think when I came to
        Alberta College of Art—Katrina Chaytor and Greg Payce were my
        instructors there—and they have big historical influences in their work
        that they draw from, and they’re also both grads of Walter Ostrom, from
        Nova Scotia College of Art Design. He’s a big “pot on pot” person too,
        which has trickled down to me. I’m also influenced by the history of
        Chinese ceramics, especially Kangxi porcelain and work from the Qing and
        Ming Dynasties. For me, it’s almost like an inside joke when I put a pot
        on a pot because I’m saying to the pot, “look how much I love you! This
        is how much I love you!” It’s almost like when you go into those
        elevators that used to be mirrored on three sides and you just see
        yourself, and then you see yourself, and then you see yourself. You’re
        projecting yourself into the thing. But I don’t know where to trace it
        back, per se, before Chinese ceramics, which I love and loathe … then, I
        did a series of Imari fish plates, so now the fish plate becomes on
        another pot, all the details become on another pot, because why not.
        When I went to grad school at Kent State University, Kirk Mangus was a
        huge lover of historical ceramics, too. I’ve been out of the teaching
        world for a long time, but I’m really curious to see if students are
        still regurgitating their love of pots in their pieces. Just as an
        aside, Kevin, I think of your pots as someone who comes in from a
        different angle into the ceramic world. They are paintings and they’re
        not on traditional pot pieces.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">KMT:</span> I do make vases, bowls, cups,
        things like that, and I’ve had galleries say “why don’t you make a big
        three-dimensional version of your thing with imagery all over it?” The
        truth is, there’s something about it that doesn’t work for me. I think
        there’s something about re-emphasizing the act of looking and the
        context of looking at something that’s definitely just an image, as
        opposed to when it’s on something where it becomes decoration or
        something. I don’t know, it’s hard to even define what I lost, but it
        just doesn’t work. Maybe it’s just that the image has to compete too
        much with the three-dimensional form, I don’t know.

        <span className="speaker">MH:</span> I am very calculated in making
        references to ceramic history. It’s a lot to do with recontextualizing,
        or reimagining our cultural relationship to that history of pattern and
        inherited pattern, the language of pattern that’s transformed from
        culture to culture as export ceramics moved from the East to the West.
        The game of “telephone” that happens in the reinterpretation and the
        appropriation of imagery, perceived value, high-low … all those things
        that are wrapped up in the history of ceramics are really important in
        my work. I’m a contemporary person who uses mugs, but I love the
        aesthetics of an eighteenth-century teacup. So putting a drawing of a
        teacup on a mug means I can still have both the functionality of a mug
        that suits my contemporary lifestyle with the aesthetics of the
        eighteenth-century teacup. It’s a way of paying homage to history. As a
        ceramic artist, you’re not reinventing the wheel, ever. You can only add
        to the historic conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to my gallery and museum work, I have a three-story-tall piece
        hanging at the High Museum, 500 plates on the wall. Museum visitors have
        told me, “well, I know those are plates, but I can also see that they’re
        a painting,” and my job is done. I’ve given the viewer an entry point to
        understanding the work in a way that gives the viewer a whole other
        reason to stop and think about the objects they live with in a different
        way. In the case of the High Museum, I’m also paying homage to history
        and doing a service to the museum by revitalizing interest in a plate
        that you would probably just walk by in the museum. I’m trying to stop
        the viewer in their tracks and have them reassess what it is about. The
        source image—a tiny painting on the surface of a Chelsea porcelain
        plate—is a painting that’s just as skilled as any other painting, but by
        putting it into a new frame of reference, on ceramic plates in a mural
        scale, I’m asking the viewer to look at each individual plate in the
        larger installation as an abstraction—asking the viewer to see the
        historic ceramic surface in an entirely new way. I’m playing with
        concepts of painting and painting history in a way that I want the work
        to say, “hey, ceramics can be painting too, let’s elevate the material.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It is really important for me how I reference history; and I don’t
        always reference the history of ceramics. The meta nature of referencing
        ceramic on ceramic … it’s a way for me to claim a painting space for
        ceramics. Whenever I wonder what to make, I just go back to history.
        Because I think it ultimately keeps me in this long, historic
        conversation about the material that I’m using. I think it’s a little
        more challenging to do that in some other mediums, and I think that’s
        why, as ceramicists, we often lean back into it. Ultimately, referencing
        ceramics on the surface of ceramics is a powerful tool.{" "}

        of the conversation, we have Molly saying, “hey, look, ceramics can be
        painting,” and then we have Kevin saying, “hey, look, paintings can be
        ceramics.” So I love that melding of the two and the pushing back at the
        institutional dichotomies and barriers there. Molly, I’d like to hear a
        little bit more about the separate identities of your gallery studio
        work, like the installations you just spoke of, and the design work that
        you’ve done in the past, such as the vases that are built from flat
        slabs with the picture of a round vessel on the side. You reference
        historical ceramics in both of them, but they seem to be for very
        different audiences. How have those pieces been received in a commercial
        setting in comparison to your museum work? Do people talk about them
        differently? Do people react in different ways?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MH:</span> No. I mean, I still think the
        message is the same. I mean, it’s a drawing of a pot on a pot. I often
        get asked “why the plate?” and so then I have to explain. The
        accessibility through our universal familiarity with the plate is a
        really important tool I use in my work to break down some of the
        pretensions of painting and fine art. I imagine those vases that you’re
        talking about that are slab vases that are really denying the original
        function, except that they’re still functioning as vases and functioning
        as drawings of vases as well. They read as this very flat,
        two-dimensional thing even though they’re still operating as a vase.
        They could sit with a display of other historic vases. So for me it’s a
        bit like poking fun, but also reinterpreting the historical reference
        for my own interests.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Do you always directly reference a
        specific historical object, so you can point to it in a museum and say,
        “this is that exact thing”? Or is it sometimes an imagined form or
        interpreted stylistic reference?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MH:</span> It’s always a very specific piece,
        and I’m often doing a lot of homework and research about why I’m
        choosing that piece for that show or that collector or museum.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> So, Mariko, same question to you:
        are you always referencing specific objects from history, or just
        adapting the style, or both?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MP:</span> I think that the work can fold in
        all of these historical references and they can keep reinventing
        themselves in new and super-interesting ways. When I was teaching at
        Greenwich House Pottery, I worked with Peter Lane, who’s in New York,
        and we’ve kept in touch for years. During the pandemic, he took me aside
        and said, listen, I want you to start making small stuff to sell, and he
        basically set up a pandemic residency for me, so I got to explore
        historical pieces a lot more during that time—mostly focused on Chinese
        and Japanese work. I accumulated about 30 pieces that are in New York
        right now, so we’ll hopefully have a show at some point. In the
        meantime, he also curated a boutique auction show in Paris and one day
        he called to say that all my pieces had sold. So the lesson learned is
        that there is an audience for this work.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> And, Kevin, how about you? Looking
        at the simplicity of the outlines, it feels to me more like archetypal
        vessel forms and not direct references, but I could be wrong. Do you
        reference specific historic objects? Or since you sometimes use domestic
        settings, do you ever look at the pots in your kitchen and draw a scene
        using those exact forms?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">KMT:</span> No, more often than not, they do
        come from specific historical objects. The truth about making stuff, and
        something that I try to keep alive in how I make images, is that things
        change. You can bring an idea to something, but you have to acquiesce to
        whatever wants to be made. I can try and draw a specific object, but who
        the hell knows what actually will come out? A successful piece is
        usually determined by your ability to do that dance and give up on the
        idea you sat down with to keep up with the momentum of the work.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> That makes sense. You can start
        with the historical reference in mind, but it’s not going to be a
        one-to-one equivalent.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s been so interesting to hear about everyone’s different approaches
        to this, but unfortunately we’re getting close to our time. I’d like to
        open it up if anyone has any final thoughts they’d like to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MP:</span> I’d just like to compliment both of
        the other artists. I’ve known Molly’s work for forever and have always
        been a big fan, and I’ve always credited her with the Mishima technique
        that she uses. I think the art world in general is super interesting and
        fluid, but there’s something about how I was brought up in the ceramic
        world that kept me bouncing within certain parameters and feeling
        pigeonholed, until recently when I’ve been able to give myself a little
        more time to make what I make and explore those odd avenues. So, Kevin,
        I’ve always liked to champion people who come at ceramics from another
        angle, like you do. I know it makes some people angry sometimes to see
        your work in a gallery and they’ll say “that's not the ‘right’ way,
        where did he come from?” But you don’t let yourself get pulled into
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">KMT:</span> It’s a strange position to be in
        because as soon as you get a little too much technique, your work
        becomes too “slick.” I’m not encumbered by the same parameters, the
        pigeonholing that you’re talking about, because I’m not coming from that
        background. I went to study philosophy and then ended up with a BFA in
        studio art, and I’m still just trying to find different ways to think
        about stuff. I’m not taught within any tradition and I’m not beholden to
        anything; I’m actually trying to stay as slippery as possible so I can
        grow. So my parameter right now is the truth about professionalizing
        what you do, when you suddenly have all these demands and expectations
        because that’s what the market is and that’s what contemporary art is a
        lot of times. I’ve been reading a lot about the superficial divide
        between craft and fine art, which of course is a conversation that you
        and Molly and other potters have already had to reckon with, and I’m
        grateful that from where I am right now, I can sit back at a really safe
        distance from that and find it so abstract and arbitrary, but just feel
        free and happy that I’m making what I make. But there is a balance to
        find because, yes, I’m unbound to the heinous standards of quality in
        the ceramic world, but I have to maintain a professionalized life as a
        creative practitioner of various mediums, and Lord knows that the quote
        “art world” and market are monstrous and idiotic and cruel.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> I do think there’s a certain type
        of freedom to be found where you are, Kevin, situated on the outskirts
        of the ceramics world. You can explore what you want to and say, “this
        is what I’m doing, and it doesn’t matter what you say it has to be.”
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        On that note, thank you all for such a wonderful conversation today. I
        really enjoyed meeting you all and hearing about your own work and your
        insights on this topic.
