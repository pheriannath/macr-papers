        Visual theorist and art historian W. J. T. Mitchell (professor of
        English and art history at the University of Chicago) is widely
        recognized for his writings on iconology and visual culture. I first was
        introduced to Professor Mitchell’s writing during my work in the Spring
        2021 semester with Meghen Jones, professor of art history at Alfred
        University, as part of the MACR mentorship program. When I first came to
        her with a fledgling idea of a possible Practicum project of
        self-referential craft (which I had begun to call “metacraft” in my
        mind), she directed me to her dissertation work on postwar Japanese
        potter Tomimoto Kenkichi, where she connected Mitchell’s essay
        “Metapictures”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        to a subset of Tomimoto’s work wherein he depicted the image of his own
        ceramic vessels on another ceramic surface—which she then dubbed
        “metaceramics.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-2">2</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        It was a truly serendipitous moment that not only gave me confidence
        that I was on the right track with my interest in this work, but also
        directed me toward a scholarly theory that I could turn to as a
        foundational text. I was curious how this visual theory that was rooted
        in images could be applied to craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professor Mitchell was kind enough to speak with me over Zoom to discuss
        how he came to define the concept of the metapicture, the value of
        personifying the picture as a strategic framework for understanding
        visual culture, and how metapictures theory can be applied to the
        concept of self-referential craft objects. Elaborating on his journey to
        develop this theory, Professor Mitchell describes his desire to think
        about images “beyond art history,” leading to metapictures as visual
        expressions of culture that “theorize themselves” by revealing something
        about their own nature. We then move the conversation to applications of
        this theory to a possible meta<em>craft</em>, where Mitchell shares his
        thoughts about the importance of the presence of the hand in both
        craftwork and pictures. Craft is also deeply connected to the material,
        so by looking at specific examples where the material “calls attention
        to itself” and “asserts its presence,” we can begin to see how images of
        craft objects can help us understand our relationship to craft in the
        world.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This interview was the first component of this publication that I
        completed, and these thoughts from Mitchell on material feel even more
        relevant to me now in retrospect. As the project grew and I gathered
        more and more examples of objects that I thought could fit under this
        umbrella category, I began to see a visual trend that was overwhelmingly
        more prevalent in ceramic surface decoration imagery than in other craft
        media. Mitchell speaks of materiality of pictures in the context of
        modernist abstract art as an “assertion of the surface and of the
        material,” and we see this also in the use of the dimensional ceramic
        surface to refer to the material of both the tangible object and the
        objects that are depicted. As this project shifted toward a more
        specific material focus, it opened up other possible interpretations of
        these works: as homages to the clay material and ceramic form, as
        historical documents that connect to a lineage of material culture, and
        as reflections on the maker’s identity as a craftsperson. In the next
        section of this publication, I present a selection of the objects that I
        encountered during my search that revealed these connections to me.{" "}

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">Tina Wiltsie:</span> I’d like to start off the
        conversation by jumping into this essay, “Metapictures,” which is the
        second chapter in your book <em>Picture Theory</em>—and I know you’ve
        written about the concept later on as well. I’d love to just
        contextualize that text a bit and ask what drove you to identifying and
        writing about this specific category of pictures that you’ve seen?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">W. J. T. Mitchell:</span> Well, it was, I
        think, very much a product of its moment in the study of culture and the
        humanities. Starting in the 1970s and 80s, I grew up with a generation
        that was very interested in the theory of everything. And I came from
        literature and the visual arts because my dissertation was about William
        Blake, who I wrote about as an artist and a poet, and particularly about
        his illuminated books, which combined image and text. The question of
        the relation of images to language was very important to me, given my
        interest in composite art forms where the two media come together, and
        it always struck me that the theory of language was very well advanced.
        Linguistics, of course, is the science of language, and philosophy of
        language was highly developed, but the philosophy of pictures had not
        been studied as much. There was an ancient discipline called iconology,
        which you could translate as the science of images, but it was mainly
        seen as something inside of art history. And I wanted to take it outside
        art history, I wanted to think about images beyond the arts: in everyday
        life, in the media, in cinema, television, advertising … and the kind of
        ordinary use of images: the way people take pictures, how they behave
        with their pictures.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I had written a book in the 1980s, exploring the relation of images
        and language. It was called <em>Iconology</em> and it had chapters on
        different ways of thinking about the difference between words and
        images.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-3">3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Is it a difference of sensory channel for the eye and the ear, with
        language belonging to the ear and pictures to the visual? That was one
        kind of figure of difference. Was it a different way of understanding
        signs? The idea of signs by resemblance, in the case of pictures, and
        signs by arbitrary convention, in the case of language. Also, there was
        the classic text, <em>Laocoön: On the Limits of Poetry and Painting</em>{" "}
        (1766), by G. E. Lessing, that said, “language unfolds in time, pictures
        unfold in space.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-4">4</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        So those figures of the difference: eye and ear, icon and symbol, and
        space and time. But then, when I turned to <em>Picture Theory</em>, I
        wanted this not just to be a theory of pictures but I wanted to ask,
        could pictures theorize themselves? Do they always have to be under the
        thumb of language, so to speak, so that language is what tells you what
        a picture means? What if a picture could tell you already, and what if a
        picture could present abstract thoughts and philosophical claims? And it
        seems to me that took us beyond the visual arts … to the entirety of
        culture and media. If you study poetry, you understand that it is made
        of language, and language is a bigger thing, language is the medium
        where poetry appears. So that was the context for asking a similar
        question about images and pictures, and their relation to vision, to
        mimicry and similarity, and to language. It was an effort to make
        pictures more active in the project of philosophical theory.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The word “theory” also had become loaded in the 1980s. Fred Jameson
        famously said, “theory is that form of philosophy that is conscious of
        its own mediation by language.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-5">5</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Philosophy for a long time had been trying to understand media with
        technical languages like semiotics, and Jameson said, no, theory is when
        philosophy falls back into language. Well, I said, okay, that’s a great
        inspiration to me. My picture theory will be when the pictures start to
        theorize themselves. That led, of course, immediately to the idea of
        pictures within pictures, pictures that were showing themselves inside
        of a frame, or showing other pictures, not themselves. So that led me to
        the philosophical problem of self-reference. What does it mean to refer
        to yourself or to refer to something inside of you? It turned out there
        is just this unbelievably rich, ready-made archive of examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I started looking at all kinds of things. Cartoons were very
        important to me, because cartoons often have a kind of humorous approach
        to the question of depiction. They don’t have to be too serious or
        solemn, they can play with pictorial representation. I particularly love
        Saul Steinberg because Steinberg is a philosopher whose medium is
        pictures. I also looked at pictures in which picture-making is
        happening, so it’s not just a picture within a picture, but it’s a
        picture of the process of making a picture, sometimes the same one
        you’re in. Steinberg really loved that idea, showing the draftsman
        drawing, and himself drawn into the circle, and the whole idea of being
        drawn into the picture you’re in, being inside your picture.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-6">6</a>

          1892, issue of <em>Fliegende Blätter</em>. This drawing is one of the
          most iconic examples of the multistable image, which Mitchell
          discusses at length in “Metapictures.”

      <p>
        Probably the philosopher who was most important to me at that time was
        Wittgenstein, who had started as a philosopher of language, but in
        philosophical investigations he turned to pay a lot of attention to
        images, and he said these incredibly weird things, like “a picture held
        us captive, and we couldn’t get outside of it, for it seemed to repeat
        itself to us.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-7">7</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        And I thought, yes, why does that resonate so much? Then he wrote
        beautifully about the Duck-Rabbit and the ambiguity of pictures, showing
        that pictures are always double. They show you something, and then they{" "}
        <em>are</em> something at the same time. And what they are may not be
        the same as what they show, though sometimes they are the same, they
        show themselves inside themselves. The phenomenon of the{" "}
        <em>mise en abyme</em>, the infinite regress of the image repeated
        inside itself endlessly, is a vertiginous example. When I was a kid, I
        used to study the Quaker Oats box on the breakfast table, because it
        showed a Quaker holding a box of Quaker Oats, on which another Quaker
        was holding another box of Quaker Oats. And then the multistable,
        ambiguous images had always obsessed me. Wittgenstein made me understand
        that this was not just a minor trick or game, but played a serious,
        essential role in pictorial representation.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        You asked how the book <em>Picture Theory</em> was received. It was
        amazing to me; it was a big success. It won two prizes right away: the
        Modern Language Association prize and the Morey Prize for art history.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-8">8</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        I don’t think any book has ever won both art history and literature in
        the same year, so it became, in academic terms, a best seller. It got
        lots of reviews, mostly good reviews, a few, you know, cranky reviews,
        but it was quite a big success. One thing is that the metapictures essay
        is just one of the chapters, and there’s also one called “The Pictorial
        Turn.” It was about the historical moment when people started to look at
        pictures a different way. The idea of “the pictorial turn” was based on
        philosopher Richard Rorty’s “linguistic turn” in philosophy, and the way
        that philosophy became obsessed with language.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-9">9</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        And it seemed clear to me that a pictorial turn was happening in
        contemporary culture, and it was time to think about a turn toward
        pictures in philosophical and theoretical reasoning.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> So, from there I gather that these
        ideas kind of evolved into your next book, What Do Pictures Want?

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> Yes, well, it took a long time.
        [laughs]
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Yes, of course. I love that idea of
        giving the picture itself agency and asking, what is the picture
        teaching us? What is the picture doing? You talk about pictures
        “wanting” things and “needing” things, and I would love if we could dig
        into that aspect of it a little bit more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> Many things had to happen before
        I was able to even think of that question. I started writing in the
        1990s—almost by accident—about dinosaur images, and I wrote a book—my
        favorite book of all—called <em>The Last Dinosaur Book</em>.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-11">11</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        It was provoked by a commission from <em>London Review of Books</em> to
        write a review of <em>Jurassic Park</em>. I sat down to write the review
        and I said, okay, I want to solve the mystery. Why is{" "}
        <em>Jurassic Park</em> the most popular film in the whole world? I
        thought somebody must surely have answered this question already. Why is
        the dinosaur important? What does it mean? And then I found out nobody
        had really asked the question, that they’d taken it for granted. So I
        tried to write a history of the invention of the dinosaur image, its
        emergence as a mass-culture icon, and its role in American elementary
        education. Why, in the United States, does every first grader go through
        a ritual of the dinosaur instruction? These questions led me into all
        kinds of strange pathways: historical, about the naming classification,
        and then, of course, the representation. There were dinosaurs in Central
        Park in the 1880s, they were in Crystal Palace Park in London in the
        1850s. So more and more I began to think about these very specific kinds
        of images, the varieties of them, and how they presented a whole lost
        world of a time when a completely different form of life dominated the
        planet Earth. No longer with us, but they had been here, and left their
        traces. There was a banner, in Jurassic Park, that said “when dinosaurs
        ruled the Earth.” I thought, whatever else they mean, dinosaurs are kind
        of counterpart to us: we human beings rule the Earth here as Homo
        sapiens. Then in this lost world, there was this parallel. We use
        dinosaurs to send lessons to ourselves about power, global domination,
        and (above all) the reality of the extinction of species, the
        realization that nothing guarantees the continued existence of the human
        species. We are a relatively short-lived experiment in evolution, a mere
        blink of the eye in the long history of the planet. And in the era of
        the Anthropocene and climate change, we have become a danger to
        ourselves and others.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This, in turn, led me to the idea that images have a very kind of
        intimate relation with life forms. They’re not just inanimate things. We
        endow them with life. There’s lots of magical thinking about images …
        and, I don’t know, some day late in the 1990s it crossed my mind that
        images are like life forms. And what does it mean to be alive? One of
        the answers to that is, to be alive is to have needs, demands, desires,
        to want things. Of course, it was with the rise of studies of racial
        difference and gender studies as well. The classic, very old question,
        “What do women want?”—always asked by men, you know—"Why are women so
        mysterious?” What do other people want from us? It’s a way of defining
        it. So I thought, let’s try that with images. What do pictures want?
        Sometimes, you know, a question doesn’t go anywhere, but that one really
        did it. It had legs. Particularly, I began to think about the way we
        attribute life to images, even though we know very well they’re not
        alive. I want to emphasize that I am not, myself, an animist, I don’t
        think they’re alive. I know that. But I also feel something which
        actually contradicts what I think. Some images are very lifelike, some
        images seem to look back at you ... and some images, you feel like you
        don’t want to hurt them, you don’t want to damage them. One of the
        lessons I always gave to my students, when I started thinking about
        this, was, “Do any of you have a picture of your mother, or brother, or
        sister in your wallet? Take it out. And now I want you to tear it up.”
        Nobody will do it. No. Absolutely not. “But do you think it’s alive?”
        No, I don’t think it’s alive. “Do you think it feels the violence?” No,
        I don’t think it feels that. Okay, then what’s going on here? Of course
        then the discussion starts with figuring what’s going on here. Why do we
        have this double attitude when we know better?
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Exactly. The picture itself is not
        alive, but it does have a life, in a way. And I also think about the
        double-sided idea of the picture that has a life of its own, but then
        there’s also, inevitably, people or a person that made that
        picture—whether it was a photographer, an artist, or a team of people
        working on the same thing. So I’m curious about that part, too. Do you
        separate the life of the person who made the image and the life that the
        picture itself has? And if so, how do you do that?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> I don’t separate them. Though of
        course I might separate them if I didn’t know who made it, if it’s just
        an image I run across … and of course, there are lots of pictures I
        don’t care about, these are special ones. We all turn out to have these
        attitudes, which you might think of as bordering on magical thinking,
        but not about all of the images out there. In fact, I would say it’s
        exceptional. It’s a very few that we pick out and say, that one is
        special to me … you know, I’m not going to damage it, I’m going to keep
        it, it has something that I care about. It was in this place that I
        turned toward the anthropological literature on this subject, especially
        the work of James Frazer, Claude Lévi Strauss, and Michael Taussig, and
        other anthropologists who’d written about what you might call magical
        thinking about images.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> So now I’m curious also about how
        framing pictures in this way and giving them agency as autonomous
        objects can help us understand how humans construct culture using
        images, both in how we create images and in the way that we interpret
        the images that we see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> I think it’s a kind of
        unavoidable tendency in human behavior. That is, we are symbol-using
        animals: we’re speaking animals, but we’re also animals with vivid
        imaginations and we have brains, which are probably too large for our
        own good, filled with memories. It’s almost as if we can’t help
        ourselves. We are animals who dream, and we dream in images and sounds.
        I think that was the fundamental recognition that linked the whole
        project of <em>Iconology, Picture Theory</em>, and{" "}
        <em>What Do Pictures Want?</em> together: the human animal as a creature
        driven by, filled with, and obsessed with images of all kinds. I suppose
        Wittgenstein’s remark, “a picture held us captive,” was in many ways the
        inspiration for it, because if you ask, who is the “us?” All of us.
        We’re all in various pictures that we have constructed around ourselves.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Thank you so much for walking us
        through your process for that. I’d like to shift gears a little bit to
        continue on from this. As you know, with my personal research and this
        particular project I’ve been working on, I’ve been really interested in
        applying this concept of the metapicture to craft objects, to see what
        happens when this visual theory of the picture is incorporated into
        craft analysis by looking at the pictures that are on the surface design
        of handcrafted pieces. I’ve been using your framework as a way to make
        sense of this self-referential imagery that I’ve been seeing on craft
        work that is a three-dimensional and tangible object, but on the outer
        surface there is also the two-dimensional representation of another
        craft object. Like the way that metapictures has different categories,
        I’m seeing here that there’s self-referential craft that shows an image
        of the same object, but there’s also craft that talks about other craft,
        or craft that refers to the making of itself. I’d love to pick your
        brain about this a little and try to find some of the boundaries of
        where the theories overlap and where maybe this metacraft concept can
        diverge in some ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> I like the idea of extending this
        concept of self-reference to craft in the sense of technique, or skill,
        or technology, and I think it’s already there inside of a lot of
        metapictures. I think particularly in the ones I’ve mentioned which
        involve drawing. I mean, not all drawing is called Art. There’s
        children’s art, there’s the scribbling that I do on a message pad … and
        it involves the hand, it’s hand work, you have to train your hand
        somewhat to do it … there are techniques of drawing. The crafts are very
        specific, they are things like working with metal, or working with
        porcelain, making jewelry. But how does the element of self-reference
        come into it? I’m not sure, I’m just asking. With drawing, I think it
        comes in when the hand enters the picture, the hand is not outside the
        picture but it comes into it and becomes a character in the picture.
        Again, Steinberg’s <em>New World</em> is, to me, not just a metapicture,
        but it’s a picture about drawing. Insofar as drawing is a craft, it’s
        the easiest drawing you can do; it’s taking the pen and swirling it into
        a spiral. It’s a scribble. It’s a freelance doodle. And Steinberg
        obviously has a very gifted hand, he makes a perfect spiral; mine would
        be a little squiggly, I’m afraid. So insofar as craft has to do with
        skill, I think metapictures have a lot of metacraft in them in the sense
        that they reflect on how they were made.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many examples in the Metapictures Atlas, I can mention some
        images
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-12">12</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        —most of these are in the first cloud, the ones called Picturing
        Depiction—and one of my favorites is the picture of the invention of
        drawing, which shows a young woman who’s tracing the shadow profile of
        her lover, and when you look closely at it you can see his profile in
        the shadow, and she’s tracing it, but her writing instrument is not a
        pencil or pen or brush, it’s an arrow.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-13">13</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        She’s scratching the outline on the wall, and then you realize that the
        arrow is Cupid’s arrow, because the claim of the picture is the origin
        of drawing is love. It’s because you want to hold onto something that
        you might lose. And he is leaving, that’s the story behind the picture,
        he is going off to war, he may never come back. She is holding onto him,
        holding on to his shadow, and she’s getting help from Cupid sitting
        there, guiding her elbow and helping her make an accurate drawing, and
        because that’s not enough, he’s also holding up the torch to cast the
        shadow. So the whole picture is a myth of, why did we invent drawing in
        the first place? And the answer of this story is love, and of others who
        we want to hang onto, we don’t want to lose them. This is one way to
        hang onto something that you don’t want to lose: draw a picture of it.
        I’ve always loved that story. In beginning, with the metapictures
        concept, this is a perfect one, in my view, because it also raises the
        question of skill—she’s just learning to do this, so who’s helping her
        know how to do it? Well, Cupid is in there. Then, according to the
        story, her father, who’s a sculptor, goes on to make a three-dimensional
        version of the departing lover. So there’s that, then there’s something
        really simple—I mean, it’s a complicated picture, but … there’s Escher’s
        two hands with one on top of the other, and they’re drawing each other.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-14">14</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Again, it’s incredible skill, because the hands are very realistic, they
        have texture and shadow and everything. They’re not just simple pictures
        and they all go back to the hand. So that’s one place I look for craft
        in a metapicture: the presence of the hand.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing—and I just thought of this because of your question about
        the material—when the material calls attention to itself in a way that
        it is not just there, but it asserts its presence. If you ask yourself,
        where does that happen? Well, in painting, it was the root of the first
        Expressionist movement, the handling of paint. So I’m going to make a
        picture of you, but the picture is not just going to be a transparent
        window that I look through, the paint is going to be thick and it’s
        going to assert its presence. It’s going to say “I am not just a picture
        of you, but I am a <em>painting</em>.” The Expressionist schools of
        painting, I think, were the first to say painting is about this material
        thing. Whether it’s water and pigments, or oil … and then, it kind of
        goes against the canon of art history, but I feel like abstract painting
        was an assertion of craft. Because it was an assertion of the surface
        and of the material. In fact, it was a very aggressive assertion, it was
        saying this picture is not of anything except itself. Now the
        modernists—Clement Greenberg, Michael Fried, and the great theorists—all
        called it “abstraction,” but what could be more concrete than an
        abstract painting, right? So insofar as craft means material, pay
        attention to the material, don’t just look through it … I think was an
        assertion of the identity of art and craft by saying, you know, I’m
        going to make you look at nothing but the paint, and I’m going to make
        you look at the way I put on the paint. In the case of Jasper Johns, I
        love his <em>Flag</em> paintings where you see right away, this is a
        flag, but that’s not all you see. You see that this is not a flag, this
        is a painting. And the paint is asserting its presence in a way that a
        realistic picture of a flag would not.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Right, I love that. You see
        something that reads as a flag, but simultaneously you understand that
        it’s not a flag. I’m reminded of the infamous Treachery of Images, by
        Magritte, as well.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-15">15</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        You write in the essay that it declares itself with the language in the
        image, “this is not a pipe,” even though we see it is a pipe, but we
        also know it’s not a pipe, it’s a representation of a pipe. One of the
        things that I find curious about the potential of metacraft objects is
        that a lot of the time they’re tangible and dimensional, so we interact
        with them in a tactile way differently than most pictures. So it’s
        almost as if there was the pipe on the surface of a pipe … so the object
        is a pipe, and there is also the image of a pipe that is not a pipe, but
        it’s asking you to imagine another version of that same thing that
        you’re holding in your hand. I just find that all fascinating.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> When it comes to the question of
        what pictures want, I think the last sentence of that essay was,
        "there’s some pictures that don’t want anything, they have everything
        they need." This happened to coincide perfectly with Michael Fried,
        who’s an old friend of mine, saying “the picture turns its back on you,
        it doesn’t care about you, it’s got its own world, its own thing.”
        That’s the kind of picture that was Michael’s favorite kind of picture,
        he likes the ones that don’t need us. They don’t want anything from us,
        they are self-sufficient, and perfect. These are all the language games
        we play—objects and images—but I think we need to know that’s the way we
        feel about them, that’s the sense we make out of them. So listen to the
        strange things people say in front of works of art.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> We see this in craft objects as
        well, so often they’re functional and we see them in use and sometimes
        they’re more decorative, but even a purely decorative vessel by its
        nature could hold something if you wanted it to. So I wonder if those
        objects need us, if humans are the ones that give it function. And what
        does that mean for the pictures on the surface? Do those pictures need
        us, do they need the object? I’m trying to kind of reconcile this
        connection between the object and the surface and how we interpret the
        object as a whole alongside the pictorial content on the surface, which
        I feel is something that is too often overlooked in craft discourse.
        It’s common in museums and exhibition catalogs, for example, to find
        just a straight description—this depicts a flower, or a landscape, or
        such-and-such pattern—but there’s rarely any deep analysis of the
        meaning behind those pictures on the work.

        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> I was trying this
        morning—thinking about the vase and the two faces—to draw a vase within
        the vase. Did a terrible job, it’s a completely messed-up drawing. But
        the other thing that strikes me with the vase/two faces is that one of
        the things is the object and what surrounds the object, you might call
        it the positive space and the negative space. One of the keys to the
        vase illusion is you see two profiles, but the vase is the object in
        between, or the empty space in between. So sometimes the object seems to
        disappear.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> Oh, I love that. It’s like the
        Duck-Rabbit picture you mentioned before—you see one thing first, but
        then you see the other thing and you do this sort of double take. I’d
        like to ask you now about one of the other possible distinctions that
        I’ve been thinking about between metapictures and metacraft and where
        they overlap. We touched on this a bit earlier in the conversation with
        both pictures and craft that refer to their own making, and I’ve also
        been thinking a lot about what happens after that making and the ways
        that craft objects often move as commodities through the world, which
        seems to me—not always, of course—to be different than how pictures are
        usually disseminated. There are some metacraft pieces I’ve found that
        seem to reference the making of the piece, but also the trade,
        inventory, and the industry of that piece. For example, there are some
        Greek pieces that have drawings of a marketplace and within that image
        there are a whole bunch of other vases in the very distinctive shapes of
        the time. I’ve been very curious about that, and am wondering if you
        have found that in pictures as well?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> Well, there’s Hogarth, the great
        British engraver, who has an engraving which I’ve always loved. It was
        about the arrival of competition from Italy and he shows a picture of a
        ship in the harbor with the gangplank coming down to the dock. And on
        the gangplank are hundreds of Italian paintings that are marching down
        off the ship, and they are all lined up in rows of the same repeated
        images, religious and mythological subjects like [the] Madonna, the Rape
        of Europa, Apollo and Marsyas. And he has an English painting greeting
        them as they come ashore and the English painting is stabbing the first
        picture off the boat. As if to say, “we don’t need your damn Madonnas!
        We have enough Madonnas here! Stop invading us with these clichéd
        religious pictures, good old English painting is enough for us!” It’s a
        wonderful metapicture, I think, showing a battle of different kinds of
        pictures. And it reflects a real situation, there was a market, these
        were commodities, and there was competition. Different kinds of picture
        makers. So it’s an endless subject, really. Another version of it in one
        of the clouds in the Metapictures Atlas is called “Showing Seeing,” and
        that is about pictures that try to show us what it is to look at
        something. I think my favorite being the moment when two guys are
        standing in front of a window looking at the skyline of New York City
        and one is saying to the other “it’s not a high-resolution screen, it’s
        a window.”

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">TW:</span> That’s so true, how culture, which
        surrounds us always and changes over time, has such an impact on the
        ways that we perceive things visually. Which is another reason why this
        project has been so interesting to me, casting a wide net across
        history, because when I started to identify this sort of theoretical
        category of craft, I realized that there’s just too much and there would
        be no way I’d be able to fit it all into my Practicum. So, for that
        paper, I zeroed in on a specific grouping of Japanese porcelain pieces
        and now here I have the chance to explore it in all directions, look at
        contemporary artists on Instagram and ancient Greek vases, and
        everything in between. It’s been so interesting to have those juxtaposed
        because there is this visual connection between them, but undoubtedly
        the motivations of each of the different makers is vastly different and
        shaped by the people and the cultures that were around at the time. Like
        you said, it really is an endless subject.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Thank you so much for all of your time and thoughts on this, it’s been
        really wonderful speaking with you. I think I’d just like to end by
        asking if you have any final words of wisdom to share.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">WJTM:</span> You know, I think the question of
        art and craft was underlying a lot of this. And since the metapictures
        don’t necessarily have to be works of art, I think that may be why it’s
        useful to you in finessing the question of art. Of course, there are
        going to be works of art, and we’re going to have ways of singling them
        out and saying, “oh, that’s art.” But to me, the idea of pictures and
        craft and images of craft, how we show this to ourselves and make sense
        of what craft is, is really a profound question. I’m glad you’re asking
        it because I think pictures help us to see it. There’s an essay I
        recently wrote about a fabric artist, an Indian artist named Shelly
        Jyoti, and there is a particular piece she made,{" "}
        <em>I Made the Center of My Own Reflection</em>.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-17">17</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        She’s a fabric artist who creates her own thread, and her own yarn, so
        she goes right down to the material foundation. They tend to be
        patterns, hangings of various kinds, very elaborate. She made one which
        really haunted me and, if I can describe it, it has a spiral, like
        Steinberg, and then the end of the spiral trails off, and it goes into a
        ball. And when you look at it, contradictory thoughts come to mind. You
        ask “Is it that the ball is the source and the pattern is coming out of
        the ball? Or is the pattern unraveling, going back into the mass of the
        ball?” I think it’s undecidable. You look at it, and you see both
        things. So when Shelly asked me, “I want you to pick out a work, what
        would you like?” I thought “that’s the one for me.” Because it’s so
        ambiguous. Because it doesn’t show your hand, you know, we don’t need to
        know that. All we need to know is here is the ball of yarn and here’s
        the pattern that comes out. Or the pattern that devolves and goes into
        the ball. Which direction does it go? And she said, “I’m not going to
        say.”
