        This is the story of an attempt to make the smallest of spaces for Black
        history in an exhibition that I curated titled{" "}
        <em>
          Crafted Roots: Stories and Objects From the Appalachian Mountains
        </em>
        .
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        It was the first exhibition I had ever curated, and my final project for
        the MA Critical Craft Studies program.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Crafted Roots</em> examined the complex relationships between
        mountain craftspeople and the urban missionaries who came to the region
        with the objective of uplifting the local communities. Ultimately, most
        of them were transformed by their time in the mountains, embracing the
        processes of traditional crafts and living the rest of their lives in
        the region. The exhibition’s scenography played upon their similarities
        and differences by dividing the gallery space between a cabin and a
        parlor. Their voices moved throughout the room across four strategically
        placed speakers, telling stories that brought them together.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        At first I felt I was presenting Appalachian craft history as it had
        never been done before by using audio extracted from hundreds of hours
        of oral history tapes and the objects chosen to support them. But all of
        these recordings and objects were drawn from the archives and
        collections held by one organization, which documents its own rich
        history of white craftspeople in the region.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        As my research for the exhibition progressed, I began to feel like I was
        perpetuating the dominant narrative. I asked myself, “Where are all of
        the Black people?” Edward J. Cabbell writes, “Black people are a
        neglected minority within a neglected minority. There are few studies of
        their existence in the hills and valleys of Appalachia.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-2">2</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        I did not have the time, sources, or knowledge to properly insert the
        stories of Black craftspeople into the exhibition. I attempted to
        address race in Appalachia through a last-minute addition of a single
        paragraph of wall text, a statement proclaiming that the lending
        organization was complicit in perpetuating the erasure of Black history
        in the region.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The statement was challenged by a colleague and staff member of the
        organization in an email sent to me, the entire staff, and the board of
        trustees (which I was the vice-president of), demanding that I take it
        down. I responded by describing the MA program, the field of craft
        studies, and that I was expected to acknowledge what was missing from
        any story, and to consider why it was missing. I explained that I did
        not think that the founding mothers of the organization were overtly
        racist, but that their work was impacted by generations of systemic
        racism in America.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I agreed to scrape the vinyl text off the wall for several reasons,
        mostly because it did not clearly articulate what I was trying to say,
        and that I was attempting to use a statement to atone for the work that
        I had not done. I documented the removal of the wall text on video. The
        text was not removed in a linear fashion, but rather in a manner that
        left keywords such as “Erasure,” “Histories,” “Black,” and “People” to
        stand out on the blank white wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing my coursework, getting my degree, and completing the
        exhibition, I began to educate myself about Black craftspeople in
        Appalachian histories. I searched for (and found) references to craft in
        the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, bell hooks, and others. I produced a
        mash-up of audio excerpts from YouTube interviews, podcasts, and oral
        histories that examines Black history and racial relations in
        Appalachia.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Both the video and the audio sat for a while in the parking lot on my
        laptop until I decided to put them together in a video titled
        “Redacted.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-3">3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        They work together in an interesting way. The visual depicts scenes of
        erasure, while the audio presents spaces of presence. “Redacted” is
        publicly available on my YouTube channel, CraftHatch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I understand that I was using the wall text to point fingers at
        others instead of taking responsibility for my own actions. A more
        appropriate statement could have read:
      </p>
      <p>
        “In this exhibition I am perpetuating the erasure of Black histories
        from the dominant regional narrative by focusing on the histories of
        white settlers, the things they made, how they made them, and their
        relationships with the missionaries who sold their work in urban
        markets.”
