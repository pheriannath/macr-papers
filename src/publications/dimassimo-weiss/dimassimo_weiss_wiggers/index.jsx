        <span className="speaker">Jill DiMassimo and Joanna Weiss:</span> So
        we’re going to begin with the end in mind. This body of work that
        students in this program have produced around Black craftspeople and
        Black craft brings their voices and their work into one publication:
        what does this work mean to you, as the head of the program who
        generated or sparked this thinking and writing?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Namita Gupta Wiggers:</span> It means that
        work I hoped would happen in the early 1990s when I was in graduate
        school is happening here, and that everyone who has been a part of the
        program will take this forward with them into many different contexts. I
        just had a conversation with Lisa Jarrett {/* TODO: Fix link*/} about
        her 100 Questions project. One of the things that came up was how it
        feels to walk into a room where there’s somebody else there to whom you
        don’t have to explain certain things. It has been really rewarding and a
        relief for the two of us that we have that shared understanding when
        walking into spaces like this MA program. It’s a different starting
        point for possibilities in terms of what you can think out together, and
        also in terms of what the physical experience, what the{" "}
        <em>visceral</em> experience of being in that room actually feels like.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And for me, what’s exciting is that you all, going forward, are starting
        in a different space. You’re going to be able to make space for
        different kinds of conversations. So when you’re in different rooms—when
        you’re in different kinds of discussions, classes, lectures, or
        conversations, or wherever you happen to be with people who need that
        kind of support, who need to know that there are other people starting
        at a different spot and more in line with where they are—that’s going to
        come through. That’s going to help create more solidarity and more
        support in more spaces. That’s what I think is exciting about community
        building, how building community means being able to help people not
        have to go backwards all the time to get to the starting point. It’s
        kind of like what you both introduced as the way we started this chat:
        beginning at the end. Or how we’ve talked about the way history is
        taught in high schools, right? History teachers get to World War Two,
        and then they run out of time, and then you can’t get past the fact that
        World War Two was a long time ago and so much has changed since then.
        You—each of you—are starting in a different spot, which means that those
        other aspects about history that get overlooked won’t get left behind
        and have to be explained before the conversation can get to some depth.
        But you all can help shape conversations in a different way. That’s
        really important to me. It’s something I craved through my formal
        schooling, and wanted to change when this opportunity to shape a
        graduate program came my way.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> What were some significant
        shifts you saw in the program, especially in the last few years
        regarding the faculty, the pandemic, the ways of thinking that were
        sparked?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> When 2020 came around, I hired all
        new core faculty with the exception of Ben Lignel, who has been a
        thinking collaborator in this project since its inception. Everything
        was happening online because of the pandemic, which made us all very
        aware of how we gathered, what we teach as much as how we teach, and how
        knowledge is established. New faculty and the strange conditions of
        teaching online opened a space to critically examine equity in our
        teaching practices. I introduced a project by Related Tactics called{" "}
        <em>Shelf Life</em> as an exercise to help us collaboratively and
        individually examine how we created knowledge through our syllabi and to
        be able to recognize the limits of what we are and are not representing
        in the assigned readings.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Shelf Life</em> is an art project designed to examine power by
        revealing bias in what is considered normative. Through the action of
        examining a bookshelf using their five prompts, you mark the book spines
        with stickers. The result is a visual and critical examination of how
        knowledge is constructed and conveyed. Is it an academic study? No. Is
        it a scientific survey? No. But what it reveals are the limitations of
        knowledge—of your knowledge and what you may pass on—based on that
        single bookshelf. I asked the core faculty to do the exercise with a
        bookshelf and with their syllabi. It was tough for everyone to realize
        who was and was not in their syllabi. When we reconvened for the next
        faculty retreat session, it turned into a very productive conversation
        about what was missing, and it gave everyone a chance to say, “I’ve been
        assigning and quoting <em>this</em> person, but I could introduce{" "}
        <em>that</em> person just as easily. Why have I never thought about
        that? Why have I been using just these chapters?” Jeff Keith, core
        faculty, for example, shared that he had chosen a Wendell Berry poem to
        kick off his class. After our conversation, he recognized that he could
        have just as easily chosen a passage from bell hooks to introduce
        Appalachian history instead. The Related Tactics project helped us get
        to these questions of power and how knowledge is reified much more
        quickly and in a different way.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        At the start of each semester from that point forward, the core faculty
        worked through these kinds of questions and critically examined our
        syllabi together to change the program curriculum. The Practicum course
        was a key pivot in this. The Practicum project was being evaluated as a
        place where students were expected to demonstrate decolonizing
        methodologies and a knowledge of a range of critical discourses. But
        that wasn’t being actively and clearly engaged in all classes—as in from
        the first class through the conclusion of the program. It was intended,
        it was discussed in the construction of syllabi, but it wasn’t being
        directly articulated. Who are you engaging? Who else are you thinking
        with? Who are you quoting in your papers? These questions need to be
        addressed over and over again from <em>all</em> core faculty.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Working with Dr. Kortet Mensah, the former Vice President for DEIA,
        Warren Wilson College, we were working collectively on the curriculum to
        take these principles and work them into learning structures and
        outcomes—to ensure that these principles were embedded deeply throughout
        the curriculum. This was one of the things we were working on literally
        the week before they canceled the program. If you go back through
        everybody’s syllabi and reading lists, you’re going to see a range of
        different kinds of citations, and you’re going to see evidence of
        thinking with scholars of the global majority. What I think shifted in
        the last two years is an explicit faculty commitment to learning how not
        just to bring in different kinds of thinking, but to actively engage it
        differently along the way. And that’s the shift of learning that I think
        your cohort experienced.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> We know that Dr. Tiffany Momon’s
        joining the program as a teaching fellow was another shift for MACR.
        Could you talk to us about your decision? Why did you invite her to the
        program?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> The summer of 2020 was brutal in a
        lot of ways. The internet became a really different kind of portal and
        access point for me. Somebody posted several research sites on
        Instagram, including feeds where people were doing research on Black
        craftspeople, and Tiffany’s website was one of them. This was before her
        Instagram blew up. This was really a crucial moment in which people were
        asking, “What’s happening? Who’s doing this research outside of those
        who are already in the decorative arts?”
      </p>

      <p>
        I went online and started looking around. I got really excited by what{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/dimassimo_momon_weiss">Tiffany</NavLink>{" "}
        was doing and reached out to her. It began casually: “Can we have a
        conversation? I’m really interested in what you’re doing, here’s what I
        do, and is there any way for us to collaborate and to work together in
        some way?” And we had several long conversations about what we both
        worked on, how she is building an archive using information that has
        been in view but never gathered in this way, and how she connects
        material culture to decorative arts and public history. I invited her to
        teach a workshop pretty quickly. And her response was, “I don’t know
        anything about craft history.”
      </p>

      <p>
        And I said, “Are you kidding me?! I need someone to teach your area of
        craft history, and it doesn’t matter if you don’t know about studio
        craft history, which is what I’ve been immersed in. This is not a studio
        craft history program. I’m trying to take this to a different place—to
        broaden what craft history can be.” That’s where our conversation
        started, and she came in and did an online workshop in January 2021.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, I asked her if she would teach the History and Theory 1
        course. This was a significant shift because I’d been teaching the
        course up until then. I was teaching History and Theory as a
        historiographical comparative course, but Tiffany offered a way of
        thinking about craft history through a different methodology that
        connects people, place, and making. That was really important to me: I
        was doing people, place, and making through studio craft history, where
        Tiffany was doing it in a way that centralized Black history
        specifically.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Can you touch on the design of
        the program application and how it came to feature object analysis? We
        saw it acting as a calling card of how this program is working to
        underscore “these are the things we want to look at, this is the thought
        we want to generate.” What kind of thinkers did you want to see coming
        into and out of the program? What kind of engagement were you looking
        for with these prompts, with this object response as one of the first
        things that they would write for the program? Was that an intentional
        thread?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> Absolutely, it was definitely
        intentional. If you start by saying, “These are the things we’re looking
        at and thinking about, and how we’re shaping the conversation,” it gives
        the students coming in a chance to understand what we’re looking at and
        thinking about before they come in. If you’re looking for a program
        where you’re going to be embedded in monographic studies of the likely
        suspects, this isn’t the right program. And by putting those objects in
        the application itself—that was my way of saying to somebody, “This is
        what we work on. Are you ready to work on this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason that I asked applicants to do an object analysis is because
        it gave me a chance to see how somebody was thinking on their own. I
        deliberately selected objects that gave people a chance to kind of dig
        in and talk about different kinds of craft histories in different ways.
        Object analysis is such a specific kind of exercise—with art historical
        expectations in terms of how it is <em>supposed</em> to be done. I
        wanted to see people experiment a bit. It really gave me and other
        faculty who were reviewing applications with me a chance to see{" "}
        <em>how</em> somebody thinks when they are given space to do what they
        want to do, when they get to run with an idea and work it out. The word
        count is very close to the same amount that you can do with most
        published exhibition reviews, so there’s a real skill in being able to
        say something substantive and clear in 500 words. It’s not easy, but it
        can be done, and it serves as an effective way to understand how
        somebody can introduce an idea and unpack it in a very short period of
        time.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        It also gave me a chance to identify where people were in their
        understanding of how to frame something in cultural contexts, to
        understand where people were in their thinking, and see how they talked
        about this work with clarity. That showed itself very, very quickly. If
        somebody was using popular catchphrases to describe the work, then I
        knew that they understood something about this piece in popular culture,
        but they needed to do more to demonstrate that they knew how to engage
        the work beyond popular lingo. As a committee, we would look for
        something that indicated a readiness for a program that is going to take
        a critical theory approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also did not want the application to be judged on the standard
        criteria used when someone moves more directly from an undergraduate to
        a graduate program. I wanted to have room for people to submit the
        things that they produced as undergrads, such as a longer paper or an
        example of other writing, and I also wanted to leave room for
        recognition that there are people out there for whom those papers were
        written ten, twenty, even thirty years ago. There’s a lot of writing,
        thinking, learning, and experiences that happened in between then and
        now. I wanted an application that somebody who was taking their life in
        a different direction could successfully complete, to give a range of
        kinds of applicants a chance to dig into an object study and show what
        their thinking is like <em>now</em>. To create a condition in which we
        could understand the person and where they <em>are</em>, rather than
        where they <em>were</em>.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Where does your experience as a
        curator in craft come through in this program? How do you think your
        curatorial background is reflected here, in the way you structured the
        program, in the way you think, in the way that you’re pulling together
        these faculty in the projects?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> I built the program and the
        residency schedules in a spatial rather than a sequential way. Each
        class meeting, meal, workshop, field trip, etc., is connected and
        linked, but not necessarily grouped or co-located together. Ben Lignel
        describes what I put in motion as “stacking.” He and I have talked about
        it in terms of exhibition-making: exhibitions are not just about putting
        objects into a room. Exhibition-making requires thoughtful consideration
        about which objects need to be in there, knowing why you are putting one
        object in over another, understanding how to arrange things to bring out
        your own thinking behind the questions explored in the exhibition, and
        leaving room for others to make their own associations.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, creating the program and schedule is along the lines of what can
        happen with thoughtful exhibition-making—it’s how you put objects on
        plinths and consider sight lines that creates meaning. In terms of the
        program, I stacked residency programming in a way that puts things in
        proximity and lets surprising connections unfold for students and
        faculty.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could trace it to my experiences in museum education, you could call
        it programming, you could call it a curatorial methodology. However you
        want to phrase it, I think it does come from a type of work, from
        curatorial practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spatialization is really important to me—what things are in proximity to
        one another? It creates new kinds of conversations and dialogues, and
        you can’t always control the flow of how somebody moves through a space.
        A lot of our museums tend to have one door on one side and one door on
        another—this is the architectural model of a sequence of rooms. When I
        was curating at the Museum of Contemporary Craft, I worked in a space
        that was a box with 20-foot ceilings and windows on two sides, and a
        staircase on one side leading upstairs from which you could look down
        onto the larger exhibition space below. You could walk through that
        larger space, look in from outside on two sides, down as you walked up
        the stairs, and had a bird’s-eye view from above. That meant that I
        could play with moving people through the space differently from most
        museums; they did not go through a sequence of rooms or follow a linear
        trajectory that had been mapped out. That space gave me the chance to
        think about strategies to open up experiences and communicate ideas
        through the way objects were choreographed. Through curating, I gave
        them a core of what I was thinking, and through the architectural space
        gave them room to move through and pick things up on their own in
        different ways—and potentially to learn things from the artists that I
        didn’t even see were there.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Most exciting, for me as an educator, is that programming is an
        absolutely essential part of curating—as much as figuring out what
        objects or artists or projects are going to be on view. Objects
        communicate certain things. But the object is made by an individual, by
        human beings, and particularly so in art and craft museums. And so it
        becomes essential for us to connect to the person who has done the
        making. I’m interested not just in the thing that has been made, but
        also in <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/perron-feller">how</NavLink> it
        came into being. What are the{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/goodman">conditions</NavLink> around how
        it’s being made? <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/devlin">Who</NavLink> is
        making it? And what are the conditions around that person? And then what
        happens to it <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/hatch">after</NavLink> it’s
        been made and it goes out{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/dimassimo">into the world</NavLink>? And
        all the conditions around that?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And so that idea that there’s lots of different ways [link to
        J_J_5.1_Weiss] people take in information and learn really stayed with
        me from museum work. I tried to bring this into the museum, to create
        possibilities for different kinds of experiences. And I tried to do that
        with this program, also, so that there were multiple ways that
        information was valued and understood, and I encouraged hands-on making
        as part of learning and thinking.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        When you curate an exhibition, or rather when I curate an exhibition,
        there is an idea and a concept—a core thing that I’m trying to
        understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next layer is asking, “what do you want to understand? And what do
        you need to understand this research question?” And that leads to, “what
        kind of objects go into the space?” But it’s about creating a meeting
        ground, and a place where what you’re framing is put out there as a
        proposition. I don’t see these as definitive statements, or as the only
        way to understand something. I want to make the ideas available for
        other people to test out and say “I see this,” or “I don’t see that,” or
        “this doesn’t explain anything to me.” That public component, that you
        experienced in the program, is very much coming from curatorial work.
        And I think this is something Tiffany and I have in common—not making
        something to just sit in a drawer or for only ten people. If you’re
        making something to put into public contexts so other people can engage
        with it, you have to set a stage for them to take it to places you may
        not have expected. And to let go; you may not be a part of where things
        head. And that needs to be okay; you need to be okay with that. That’s a
        curatorial focus—putting things out there and knowing that people might
        understand what you’re doing or they might not—and they also might
        understand something else you never anticipated and take things into a
        whole other direction.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> When we talk about the student
        work about Black craft and Black craftspeople, it’s not like we’re the
        only program that’s working on these topics. Lots of other people are
        investigating this kind of work and are working on these histories and
        contemporary practices. How does it look different from a craft studies
        approach?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> There are other programs where
        craft is written about, obviously, through decorative arts, through
        material culture, through anthropology and art history. The kinds of
        questions and the kind of inquiry that happened in this five-year
        program aimed to understand the craftsperson within other systems. I
        think what we have been trying to do is figure out a different
        attentiveness to the body, and the embodiment of a practice and a way of
        working, to explore a different relationship between people and
        materials and what making means. I’m rubbing my fingers together here,
        because it’s about touch. It’s about the physicality of it, it’s about
        the proximity to materials as much as the proximity to an object and to
        other people who are making in these ways.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think it might even take somebody outside of the program, looking
        at what has been written to help us see some of the patterns and
        consistencies that come up. I think there’s a different way that the
        program aimed toward an understanding of craft as a place of power and
        agency, rather than craft as a place of deficit, dismissal, and
        nostalgia in a negative way. To shift to a positive position right off
        the bat starts from understanding that craft is valid and valued and
        important and brings people together. And that craft spans lots of
        different cultures and communities.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And, yet, you have to also pay attention to specificity because this
        glass in my hand, it’s not the same as this ceramic material. The people
        in this program are attuned to things we touch and live with, and make
        in a different sort of way; that sensitivity to specificity comes
        through. I did not expect the program at its inception to be populated
        almost exclusively by people who are makers. With makers in the same
        room with faculty from multiple disciplines, there are kinds of
        conversations that can happen differently because of shared and
        collective sensitivity to what it means to <em>physically engage</em> in
        making and engage in an exchange of knowledge through our hands. And
        that comes out in the writing and the kinds of topics that you as
        students are choosing to engage, also.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> What if the program hadn’t
        ended? What was next? Were there other areas of the program where you
        thought, “I see an opening where we could do something better or
        differently”? Did Tiffany Momon and her class on Black craftwork inspire
        you to rethink any other parts of the curriculum? Was there something in
        the works that was unrealized?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">NGW:</span> There’s always things that don’t
        get realized. Meeting Tiffany and beginning to work with her made a huge
        difference in being able to address this question of Black
        craftsmanship. What it highlights is what other kinds of histories we
        need. We didn’t bring Indigenous craft and questions about Indigeneity
        into the curriculum as well as I wanted to. I also would have tried to
        develop a way to teach History and Theory in a more workshop-oriented
        model rather than through a comparative literature approach. That’s
        something that the faculty and I were talking about: more workshops,
        maybe more talks or conversation sessions during the semester.{" "}

        Plus we really wanted to figure out, over the last couple of
        years—thanks to the research and practice interests of Sara Clugage and
        Ben Lignel—how to include food, and food studies, and writing about
        food. It became more and more apparent that this could be a place for us
        to dig into how craft and culture are written about. We would have liked
        to have had more time to really develop that, as a different way of
        thinking about how to write about craft and craft histories. I would
        have also liked to have had more opportunities to get everybody into
        archives and collections, to get more time looking at objects together.
        It was invaluable for us to be able to be in person, and going on field
        trips at residencies made a huge difference. That would be something,
        because we could meet again in person, that I would have liked to have
        continued developing.

        There are some things that didn’t feel in step with the research and
        resource materials out in the world. I wanted our third semester to be
        about crafting and communication. I really wanted us to dig into the
        internet and what’s going on online. But in some ways, the articles are
        not written yet, because the <em>analysis</em> hasn’t happened yet. And
        so the conversations felt stilted or out of step. I was working to find
        people who have written the things that I need written so that I can get
        you all to take it to that next step. That was one frustration.{" "}

        There is thinking about craft pedagogy in many places—mostly about
        teaching making and teaching through art programs. But in the same way
        teachers in the visual arts making programs are rethinking what a
        critique is, for example, I see deeply entrenched patterns in terms of
        what topics are legitimate craft topics and repetition of how craft
        history is “supposed” to be taught drawn from art history. And I don’t
        think that necessarily matches the way the teaching is <em>actually</em>{" "}
        taking place and what it’s doing. It doesn’t really get at certain
        spaces, into the pockets—I like to get at the pockets, where there’s
        places we see things every day and still need to understand. To me,
        there’s a lot of conversations that are about apprenticeship, or
        teaching in an academic model, which is sort of the industrial complex,
        capitalist complex, production-oriented space. But that isn’t really
        helping me understand: what does it really mean when you learn to
        crochet from your grandmother sitting next to you, and what is that
        really? And those are pockets of knowledge exchange that I think we
        still don’t have the writing and analysis to draw into teaching. I would
        like to see that and to be able to approach and teach that material in
        the expansive way I like to teach.

        That’s been a part of my trying to reshape craft history for a long,
        long time. I like to quote Toni Morrison, who says, “If you don’t see
        the book you want to read, then write it.” This program was very much
        about me trying to shape the program I wished I had had when I was in
        grad school, something that had space for the kinds of conversations and
        discourse and study that was there and to be uncovered together in new
        ways.
