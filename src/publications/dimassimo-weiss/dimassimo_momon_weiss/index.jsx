      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">Jill DiMassimo and Joanna Weiss:</span> How
        did you first get started with the MACR program? What were the
        connections you found between this program and the Black Craftspeople
        Digital Archive (BCDA)?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Dr. Tiffany Momon:</span> It’s very
        interesting to me to watch how the MACR program has developed alongside
        the BCDA. The Black Craftspeople Digital Archive was always an idea I
        had, since about the summer of 2018, and then it launched in October of
        2019. I tell people it was just my little sleepy side project. And then
        the events of May 2020 happened with the murder of George Floyd, and I
        remember it being a situation where I thought, I have to say something.
        I can’t have a Black digital humanities project, no matter how tiny it
        is, and not say something. So I put out a post about my own experience
        in Memphis, as a child, with anti-Black racism. And I talked about how
        that was kind of this transformative moment, but how it really still
        bothers me to this day, even though that was 20 years ago. So that
        message comes out and it goes viral. And then I get featured in this
        Instagram post of “Eight Historians to Follow,” and then <em>that</em>{" "}
        goes viral. And it was a very interesting time for me, because with that
        first message, I was just saying what I genuinely felt in the moment.
        And for whatever reason, it resonated with people, and then I ended up
        on that historians to follow list, and it just sort of snowballed from
        there. But when Namita first brought the MACR program to my attention,
        I’d never heard of it, never heard of Warren Wilson College. I was still
        on a temporary contract with the university that I work with on a
        permanent basis now. And so when this was brought to me, it was, “Could
        you just share your research and teach an online workshop?” and I
        thought, well, that’s not too bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        So during that first workshop, it was interesting for me, because
        although the project was called Black Craftspeople Digital Archive, I
        had never really studied craft. I was always approaching this from the
        decorative-arts perspective, because that’s what I’d studied—I hadn’t
        gone deep into any craft theory, any craft historiography or anything
        like that. And so to show up at that residency that year was a bit
        intimidating, because what I’ve learned by participating in this program
        is that craft scholars don’t think like historians. It’s not that that’s
        bad. But there’s a different way of thinking that happens here. What
        I’ve noticed is that craft scholars have the ability to dream, if that
        makes sense, to consider a variety of possibilities, while traditional
        historians are very much “it happened <em>this</em> way on <em>this</em>{" "}
        day.” So that’s something that I really enjoyed, this ability to dream
        and think outside of the box. And at that first residency, I just talked
        about the BCDA. It was a three-workshop session intro to the BCDA, where
        we did a little bit of virtual objects study, and that went well. Then
        the next thing I know, I’m working with Melanee Goodman on her final
        paper [on Black craftswomen in southern Appalachia], which was fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason I’m a professor is because I like student research like that.
        If I could just sit down and talk to students about projects all day,
        that’s all that I’d do all day. So it was fun, being a mentor in the
        program and helping with these research questions. And then I continued
        working with Melanee and then it just sort of snowballed. And it just
        kept going and going and going. And it’s a great little break from sort
        of the rigors of the traditional academic world, to be able to come and
        participate even in this very small workshop way. And dream, and think
        of possibilities, and new ways of being and new ways of doing.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> How did you go from planning a
        three-day workshop, and the next thing you know, you’re planning a whole
        semester-long course? What were you carrying forward from those workshop
        experiences, the mentoring experiences, other teaching experiences that
        you’d had?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> When I thought about structuring
        the course, what I really thought about was the course that got me
        started in the decorative arts. I was immediately inspired by the Museum
        of Early Southern Decorative Arts (MESDA) Summer Institute. What you do
        for a month at that summer institute is you pick a project—you pick a
        person, an object, an architectural interior, whatever—and it’s yours
        for the month, you do research on it from beginning to end. And so I
        thought I’d structure this class that way, because it’s a model that
        works. So in those first few days, you’d pick your object, person,
        etcetera, etcetera, and you’ll just ride it out with them until the end
        of the semester, find everything that you can find, put it into a paper,
        and take it that way. But one of the things that I was really also
        thinking about in doing that work was research. And that was just from
        my own experience in graduate school, and listening to my dissertation
        adviser complain about students not knowing how to find primary sources,
        and students not knowing how to research. So I thought, if I could
        somehow put all of this together, where you can have this one project
        that culminates into this bigger project, and teach some research
        methods along the way, those research methods are then things that the
        students can take with them beyond the subject matter.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And then I also thought, I love to have a course with a soundtrack. So I
        picked out a <NavLink to="#">soundtrack</NavLink>{" "}
        {/* TODO: Link to link to Momon piece in Ben and Namita’s
        publication when article is present */}{" "}
        for the course, just songs that talked about moving and going—it was a
        lot of soul music, really. And I picked out readings that I was
        interested in, readings that I wanted to discuss with other people, and
        thinking about the ways that craft scholars don’t necessarily think the
        way historians do, or don’t approach research the way historians do, and
        thinking about discussing these traditional topics in creative ways, and
        really having conversations with people with like-minded interests. I
        think one of the biggest things that happened when I was thinking about
        the course was that it wasn’t just an opportunity for me to teach, it
        was also an opportunity for me to learn.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Is there anything that comes to
        mind, things that you learned from this program, or things that changed
        the way you think? Not just how the craft scholars think but the way you
        thought about craft?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> I think it was becoming a little
        bit more comfortable with theory. That was always the part in my
        training that I hated was the theory portion—I was like, I want to
        practice, I want to practice, I want to practice! But you can’t practice
        without the theory. It’s a two-way street. The theory was always
        something I was like, oh, here we go again. So I think learning to
        embrace that has been fun. I’m not shying away from that anymore. It’s
        still not my favorite thing. But now I’m not actively avoiding it.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        And thinking about what else I learned about the program, I learned
        about <em>craft</em>. Because again, I did not have a craft background.
        So something that I really sort of started doing at the very beginning
        is, just in overhearing conversations and having the ability to sit in
        on other people’s classes, you quickly hear the same names over and over
        again, as far as theory goes. The first year I taught a class, everyone
        was talking about the book <em>Empire of Cotton</em>, and I thought,
        I’ll come back to it. Or you’ll hear these names: Merleau-Ponty,
        Heidegger. And I’m like, okay, these are things that I need to Google
        and look up and figure out what’s happening here. Because again, that’s
        stuff that just was not in my wheelhouse. And there were some even
        really basic things that I had just never thought of, like craft versus
        studio craft, because it wasn’t my background. You know, the only reason
        I went back to graduate school in the first place was because of
        genealogy, finding people. So that’s why the craftspeople project made
        sense for me, because I know how to find a person. It’s second nature at
        this point. But coupling that with this whole field, and then realizing
        that craft was something you could <em>study</em>. I thought it was just
        something you <em>made</em>, you know? Again, my thing with craftspeople
        is I’m looking at <em>people</em>, right? So it’s a very genealogical
        practice. And then while I like the art, while I’m peeking in on the
        art, you know, I’m not necessarily memorizing furniture forms.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Has this perspective on craft
        influenced any of your work at your BCDA, like the way you train or
        think about it or present it?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> I think it’s changed the way we
        operate in regards to students. It’s influenced ways that we interact
        with students on the project and the ways that we bring students into
        the project. One of the things I always say about the BCDA is that I
        don’t want to work alone. I’m a public historian for a reason. It’s
        because I cannot sit in my office all day by myself. I need to go out
        and do things. And so it’s been fun bringing more people along in this
        work. But I think even beyond that, and thinking about the student
        connection, what’s great is the ability to train students to do this
        type of research, to ask these deeper questions, to think about the
        connections between objects, primary sources, and place, and then
        watching them go. So I look at it as a practice of planting seeds,
        building up an entire army who’s going to build from my work, folks who
        are going to stand on my shoulders and go out and do great things. I
        think that’s the goal, right?
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Coming back to your question
        that you asked us from our workshop today: who are you doing this work
        for? Why do you keep coming back to the MACR program? What brings you
        back here?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> It’s students, you know? When you
        go up on the academic job market, one of the things you have to write is
        your teaching philosophy. And so my teaching philosophy is two pages
        where I talk about how it’s all about the students, right? And it really
        is. I got that from my dissertation adviser and the way that he poured
        into us. Those are the ways that I seek to pour into students. My
        thinking is always, if I’m not helping my students get to the next
        level, if I’m not helping them get to where they want to be, why am I a
        professor? What am I even doing at this point? Because I’m convinced
        that there are professors out here who genuinely don’t like students.
        And I’m always just, like, why are you in this field if you don’t like
        students? And I feel like one day there’ll be an army of people out
        doing great things, changing the field, changing the world. And then
        I’ll just be able to be, like, oh, I remember them from the MACR
        program, or I remember them from this, that, or the other. So that’s
        what it’s all about.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Well, to that point, all of the
        work in our publication, the connecting thread is really that it comes
        back to you. We have Robell and Charlie, we have{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/goodman">Melanee</NavLink>, we have{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/hatch">Mike</NavLink>, we have everybody
        in <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/placeholder">our cohort</NavLink>{" "}
        {/* TODO: Link to 5.1 when article is present */}. And it comes back to
        the way you impacted our thinking or research or lines of inquiry. How
        do you feel even thinking about that? Like even in this small program,
        not just the way people are thinking, but actually{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/hand">producing work</NavLink>, too?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> I think it’s wild. [Laughs.] Best
        way to describe it. I think that’s just wild, because that’s never the
        intention, right? You come and you lecture, you do a workshop, you hope
        somebody in the room is listening, you hope somebody finds something
        that resonates with them, something that they can take away. And the
        goal was never to really sit back and be, like, you know, I don’t know.
        “Look at these throngs of students,” that’s never the goal. So it’s just
        wild to think that’s something. I’m a forever student, so even as I’m
        teaching, I mentioned, I’m still learning. I’m still reading books, I’m
        still making sure I’m at the top of my game. So it’s just wild to think
        that people actually think I know what I’m doing! But it’s wild to just
        think that you could have an impact in that way. That’s something that
        you were sort of least expecting. Because the BCDA was just an idea.
        It’s a very basic project I formulated to answer a question of: where’s
        the Black presence in the decorative arts? And so that’s, you know, it
        started sort of there. And it's wild.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Have you seen a change in the
        field, in who is asking you questions, in what they want to know, in how
        craft is seen in your field?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> So when I started the project, I
        remember talking to my dissertation adviser about it, and I said, “Look,
        I am <em>not</em> trying to be the Black face of craft in the decorative
        arts. I’m not trying to become this person where people ask me, ‘Hey,
        can you give us a comment on this incident that happened?’” Because
        that’s an uncomfortable space for me. But it’s so interesting to me that
        when something happens in the field, I’ll get emails or phone calls or
        DMs, and people ask, “What are your thoughts? What are your thoughts?”
        I’m always, like, it’s shocking that people want to listen to me. So I
        guess it’s just part of the process.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll say the majority of the audiences I talk to are museum audiences,
        which is very interesting to me, because my master’s degree was
        historical archaeology. When I got my PhD, my concentration was historic
        preservation. It’s never been museums. And so it’s so interesting to me
        that when I was working on my PhD, I deliberately, <em>purposely</em>{" "}
        was, like, I’m <em>not</em> doing museums. So it’s interesting to me now
        that that’s sort of my primary audience. And I realize it’s for all of
        the reasons sort of connected to the BCDA, museums wanting you to come
        in and talk to their staff, or give public lectures, because they’re all
        sort of looking for an answer to this problem about how we present
        objects made by Black makers. And so it’s something that I can greatly
        appreciate, it was just something I wasn’t really expecting, because now
        it’s not just the decorative arts museums, it’s the fine art museums,
        too. And I am not an art historian.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the day, what I sort of glean from that is that these
        voices are interested in different perspectives: not just the art
        history approach anymore, but finding what they can learn from other
        fields and different approaches. And I will say, I think beyond speaking
        to museums, I do a lot of university public programs. That’s always fun,
        because the audience is populated with a majority of students, and
        that’s something I could do with my eyes closed, and talking about the
        BCDA. But yeah, those are the two sorts of primary audiences. And it’s
        really been interesting, in terms of where I’m speaking, to hear, to
        sort of watch the field change. When I gave my very first big decorative
        arts lecture in 2018, there was sort of a fear among my dissertation
        adviser and others, that for this particular audience at this
        institution—or I don’t know if it was a fear, maybe was a
        hesitation—that they wouldn’t get the lecture, that it would be too much
        for them. That, where we were at that point in time within the
        decorative arts field in 2018, I was gonna, you know, kill somebody’s
        grandmother in the audience. [Laughs.] Dec arts audiences are majority
        older people. And today, that’s not the case.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Earlier in our workshop today,
        one of the things you said was that we noted you said you were feeling
        really angry at a lot of different systems. What systems do you see
        converging and emerging around public history and craft and in your
        work?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> The systems that I am upset with,
        really, are museums. I don’t know why we have to keep having the exact
        same conversations that we have to keep having. At some point, the
        entire field, all of your employees are pushing you to change. And yet
        we have these institutions that are held captive by their board members,
        their donors, held captive by white supremacy, and bigotry, and
        homophobia, overdosing on toxic whiteness. And you have an audience,
        some parts, not the entire audience, but a segment of the audience, and
        your employees, who are all saying, “Hey, you really have to change.”
        And I think what it comes down to is, ultimately, they’re not going to
        change. But they will make some changes, some small tweaks. They’ll do a
        little bit more public programming, they might do like an after-school
        program in the inner city, might just sprinkle in a little community
        engagement stuff, they’ll do an exhibit here or there. But that’s what
        I’m mad at. Because I’m not even{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/dimassimo">a museum person</NavLink>! For
        as long as I’ve been in this world, it’s the exact same thing. People
        are asking for the exact same things, new ways of thinking about object
        labels, new ways of museums connecting with communities, new ways for
        museums to actually do exhibits on people of the global majority that
        don’t feel like lip service. Right? Things that don’t feel like, oh, we
        checked that box, now we don’t have to do this for another ten years. I
        don’t get it.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Why did you say that the one
        thing you did not want to do was work in museums, like from day one when
        you started your journey?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> I just thought it was boring! It
        just seemed like it was more fun being outside looking at buildings.
        And, I mean, that’s not to say that historic preservation doesn’t have
        the exact same arguments in that field, of “Why won’t you change? Why
        can’t you be more inclusive?” Those arguments exist everywhere and
        that’s the frustrating part.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Right, like this story you told
        us today about finding that building, you know?
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        It’s out there, and then you can go find it and petition for it to
        become a historic landmark, and tell the people, “Guess what? Guess
        where you live? This is your history. This is in your community. And
        this means something important.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> And they didn’t know! And think
        about what that does, particularly for a community like Glen Allan,
        Mississippi, of 300 people. It’s just this little community where it
        looks like no one’s touched it in 50 years, no one’s built anything
        there in 50 years, probably longer than that. And that’s why, when they
        saw us looking at that building, everyone was like, “Wait, what’s
        happening? What’s going on? What is this?” Yeah, so it was great that
        Mr. Morganfield let us in and was like, “Yeah, come look.”
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> How else in your public history
        work and research are you connecting with living Black craftspeople?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> You mentioned my stumbling across
        Mr. Morganfield. It just sort of happens. You get out in the field and
        you just meet people. And it’s part of being a public historian. But the
        best part of meeting these people is that they’re willing and ready to
        share their lives with you. And that’s not something especially in this
        day and age I take for granted. And it’s also been so fun,{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/awake_ryland">Robell and Charlie</NavLink>{" "}
        letting me tag along on their chair research project. Because again,
        it’s me looking at the way a furniture maker thinks and interacts with
        objects, which is very different from how I think and interact with
        objects.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Something incredible that they
        discussed in their presentation during our summer residency was how
        re-creating historical chairs with modern tools isn’t cheating, it isn’t
        taking a shortcut, and how if{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/devlin">Dick Poynor</NavLink> had had
        access to this kind of machinery in his time, he would have used it,
        because it would have made his life easier as well.

        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> And it’s wild to think about it.
        Right? Because you know, the exact same thoughts that Charlie and Robell
        are having in the shop, “How can I do this faster, quicker, easier?” are
        the exact same thoughts Poynor was having in his shop. That’s why he got
        the horse-powered lathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it’s so interesting to watch a maker think, and sort of troubleshoot
        and work through those problems. When I was with them at this historic
        house museum in Tennessee they had been traveling around looking at all
        the various Poynor chairs in different places, and taking an inventory.
        And they broke out this white posterboard, like the kind you’d buy for
        your kid’s school project or whatever, and they were tracing the
        outlines of the chair. And I was, like, “Wait!” I don’t know what I was
        expecting. [Laughs.] I was, like, “Wait, that’s the process?” They were
        making a pattern! It just was not what I was expecting. And I was, like,
        I can’t believe it, it seems so easy, of course you make a pattern.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">JD&JW:</span> Since the MACR program is
        ending, as it is now, are there any other ways that you connect with
        craft now that you have these different kinds of knowledge? Are there
        any other spaces that you see where you can keep this connection? What
        would you see going forward?
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">TM:</span> Something that I’m very interested
        in, and I don’t know if it’s like a pipe dream or what, but I can’t
        shake this idea of world-building, of building new worlds. I think what
        led me to deal with this program was world-building. So now because this
        program is ending, we’re in this exclusive club of people that got to
        come here and <em>be</em> in this space, and experience this and live
        this and <NavLink to="#">eat together</NavLink>{" "}
        {/* TODO: [link to piece by Clugage] */} and think together and dream
        together. Right? This isn’t something that can be re-created. It’s one
        of those things where people say that you don’t realize that you’re
        living in the good times when the good times are happening. It’s one of
        those sorts of things. And I think that’s one of the things I was
        thinking about during the{" "}
        <NavLink to="/dimassimo_weiss/perron-feller">
          residency last summer
        </NavLink>
        , when I had you all make those walking tours of campus. Because I
        thought, somebody somewhere is going to need to know that <em>this</em>{" "}
        was a program here, and <em>this</em> is how this program interacted and
        functioned on this campus.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        What I would love to do is to work with Black craft artists who built
        those worlds, who built those new spaces, and join them in those spaces,
        in those worlds. Because I think about it, too, in regards to building
        spaces where you can be who you want to be, whatever that looks like for
        you, however you define it. Like for me, I would say it’s showing up in
        the space and being Black the way I want to be Black. There’s something
        about that sort of thinking right now that I’m very attracted to. And
        thinking about space and connections in that way is something I hope to
        continue after this world comes to an end.
