        The MACR program emphasizes finding connective tissue that binds
        together different courses and various ways of thinking. In the
        following student work, these throughlines of thought chart a map that
        is more fully realized alongside Black craft histories. Here we bring
        together two contributions that center material connections to place as
        a narrative framework.{" "}

        In her photo essay and companion commentary,{" "}
        <em>
          Cowrie Shells: Movement and Connections through African American
          Material Culture
        </em>
        , Joanna Weiss (MACR ’23) traces the parallel arcs of cowrie shells in
        two forms of media: referenced in the American Girl books on Addy
        Walker, and incorporated in the sculptures of artist Vanessa German.
        Weiss addresses the similarities in both bodies of work and pinpoints
        how the cowrie shells represent the tangible and familiar within
        diasporic scenes, creating ties to place and offering a connection to
        family legacies.

        During an on-site lecture led by Dr. Tiffany Momon, Beryl Perron-Feller
        (MACR ’23) interacted with place in a way that was only possible at an
        in-person residency. By using their hands to manipulate the red clay
        soil underfoot, Perron-Feller found a point of connection to the Black
        students, teachers, and families who used clay from this same site to
        make pots and fundraise for the building of this school.{" "}

        The contributions in this section approach Black craft as a site of
        imagination and potential for exploration. Both of these writers
        demonstrate creativity in their understandings of place through material
        touchstones, and, though not evidenced here, there are connections to
        their practicum projects as well: Weiss on the role of Black craft in
        the American Girl series, and Perron-Feller on how craft heightens
        experiential education. In looking at and thinking about Black craft
        histories, these writers use place and material as archival sources, and
        continue to engage these modes of inquiry in their ongoing work.
