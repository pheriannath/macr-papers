        Thomas Commeraw was a highly skilled master stoneware potter (active ca.
        1797–1819), a leader within his community, and a successful business
        owner during New York City’s early Federal period, just after the
        American Revolution. Though his work has been collected since the turn
        of the 20th century, Commeraw’s life remained mysterious to collectors
        until 2004, when a stoneware dealer realized Commeraw was a free Black
        man. The surprised reaction of many to this information brings into view
        the assumption of his whiteness. I designed this project for a MACR
        class assignment in 2022 as an interactive map arranged as a timeline,
        inviting the reader to click each entry to follow Commeraw’s stoneware
        jar over time and place. I reorganized the text and images to work
        within the format of this publication, but it’s available in its

      <h3>Mapping Commeraw’s Jar</h3>
      <p>
        The jar hasn’t changed much since Thomas Commeraw formed it on his
        pottery wheel around 1800. It’s a storage jar, made from a silica-laden,
        dense, bluish clay dug from the place currently known as Perth Amboy,
        New Jersey. People used the jar, perhaps to store pickled beans or
        pickled eggs which they covered by putting a small plate on the top to
        keep the food submerged in the vinegary brine. And at some point it
        became an object worthy of our gaze, but not our pickled vegetables. Its
        hard and vitreous stoneware lasts a long time, and many pieces survived
        intact from this period.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my timeline, I’ve mapped occasions of display as an organizing
        principle, including display through appearance in a book, in
        households, and as part of a cultural zeitgeist. Since this mapping
        structure includes space and time, it has a dual construction. There’s
        the map pictured above, which notes the physical locations of the jar,
        and there’s the timeline, which includes locations as well as cultural
        shifts which impacted what the jar represents. Each expanded notation
        situates the jar in a context and calls forward the implications. I
        theorized that examining these constructs around one small jar would
        reveal insights about the shaping of American identity over two
        centuries. Two stories emerged from this mapping: the story of the
        construction of knowledge and value, and the pervasiveness of racism
        against Black people in America. Commeraw’s biography offers an
        interesting insight into these issues because his racial identity
        changed over time. The perception of the value of the jar is often
        interpreted through a racialized lens. The construction of knowledge,
        even about a gray stoneware vase, is not neutral.{" "}

      <h3>Jar, Thomas Commeraw</h3>
      <p>
        This is the jar that I mapped from its creation, on Corlears Hook, on
        the Lower East Side of Manhattan, to its present location, in the
        Metropolitan Museum of Art. Knowledge creation and display conventions
        are ever-changing, which can even be seen on the website entry for this
        very jar. In August 2021, the museum attributed it to Thomas Commeraw.
        By December 2021, the attribution had changed to Thomas Commeraw or
        David Morgan (a potter who worked very close to Commeraw. Their
        proximity and the similarity of their work leaves questions of
        attribution on several pieces). Recently, the attribution changed back
        to Commeraw, but the “or” still dangles on the “entry details” section
        of the collection entry, leaving a small clue to the changing state of
        history. The piece is currently on view in an exhibition with art by
        Black artisans, so the dropping of David Morgan (who was white) from the
        attribution keeps that exhibit tidy.

      <h3>Thomas Commeraw Makes a Stoneware Jar (1797–1819)</h3>
      <p>
        Thomas Commeraw operated a stoneware pottery from around 1797–1819 in
        Manhattan’s Lower East Side. At the turn of the nineteenth century,
        Corlears Hook was still remote enough to accommodate a kiln that spewed
        toxic fumes and to provide easy access to ships, water, and wood, the
        necessary resources for operating a colonial-era pottery enterprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The open-loop handles, ovoid shape, hand-incised floral design, and the
        Dutch spelling of COERLEAR’S HOOK in the mark on this four-gallon jar
        suggest it was likely one of Commeraw’s early pieces, created around
        1800.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        After the British retreat in 1783, there was a burst of manufacturing in
        New York City to meet the pent-up demand for goods unavailable during
        the war and previously imported from Great Britain. Commeraw’s pottery
        emerged during this moment of great economic opportunity for skilled
        American manufacturers. A swift stoneware potter could throw over 100
        five-gallon jugs a day, and would probably make a large batch of a
        single size at a time. This jar was one of many hand-thrown, highly
        functional commodity jars, designed for food storage in the home. He
        made the colonial version of Tupperware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Commeraw’s pottery was the first place this jar was displayed. A sense
        of nationalism infused many aspects of the new nation and buying
        American-made wares became a source of patriotic pride. As a Black man
        and an abolitionist in a city with over 2,500 enslaved people, Commeraw
        may not have felt this sense of national pride, but his white customers
        likely did. New York stoneware had a reputation for being well made, so
        Commeraw’s decision to stamp his pots with N. YORK may have been a way
        to advertise the quality of his goods. Like other potters, he probably
        sold most of his pots directly from his pottery. Of 29 potters listed in
        the New York City directories from 1797–1819, Commeraw is the only Black
        potter. We don’t know the race or the enslaved status of his customers,
        but they would have known he was a free Black man. Some of his customers
        were free Black oystermen who bought straight-sided oyster jars from
        him. A number of these oyster jars have been found on a beach of
        Suriname, likely detritus from a shipment of oysters packaged for trade.
        Although his name does not appear on this pot, it appears on many of his
        other surviving pieces.

        Commeraw Leaves America for Sierra Leone with the American Colonization

      </h3>
      <p>
        Thomas Commeraw and his family were among the 86 passengers who sailed
        to Sierra Leone on the ship Elizabeth, sponsored by the American
        Colonization Society. They planned to “return” to Sierra Leone in a
        controversial scheme to remove people of African descent from America
        and establish a colony in Liberia. The plan proved disastrous from the
        time of landing. Within six months of sailing, 49 of the original 86
        passengers had died. Commeraw’s wife, Ann, and his daughter died of
        illness shortly after arriving. Commeraw and his son returned to New
        York two years later. Commeraw died in Baltimore in 1823. None of the
        known records show that he worked as a potter after leaving New York
        City.

      <h3>Stoneware for Sale (1825)</h3>
      <p>
        This advertisement from Clarkson Crolius, one of the period’s most
        successful potteries, functions as a form of display. While scholars and
        collectors previously thought that Commeraw was a competitor of the
        Crolius and Remmey potteries, some now believe the Crolius family
        manumitted Commeraw’s enslaved parents and that Commeraw apprenticed in
        one of their potteries to learn his craft. Commeraw’s pots share many of
        the sizes, shapes, and decorative styles of the Crolius and Remmey
        potteries, whose potter ancestors emigrated from the Neuwied region of
        Germany beginning in 1725.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider this advertisement the craftsman’s own curation of a type of
        exhibition of American stoneware. Crolius highlights these attributes:
        materiality, forms and sizes, functionality, monetary and use-value, and
        availability. He packs a lot in a small space. The sales location is the
        same one as for his pottery kiln, so Commeraw likely followed the same
        convention and sold from his shop. Notice the decoration on the pieces
        is neither pictured nor described. The emphasis on low and fair pricing
        indicates that these jars were considered commodities, like nails,
        brooms, or baskets, and that people were familiar with the qualities of
        stoneware.

      <h3>
        Jar Stores Pickled Beans or Other Early American Food (1820–1880s)
      </h3>
      <p>
        After Commeraw sold the jar, it was unaccounted for until the early
        1900s. Since it holds four gallons, it was probably used in a private
        household for food storage. Stoneware pottery served an important
        food-storage function in the post-colonial period. Unlike earthenware
        pottery, salt-glazed stoneware was impervious to acids, so a jar like
        this one would probably be used for storing pickled vegetables, an
        important food in colonial and antebellum kitchens. This type of jar
        would accommodate a small plate, a cloth cover, or a sunken lid, and
        would likely be stored on a shelf or cupboard in a kitchen or in a
        cellar. The jar would have been kept on an open shelf where the
        decorative cobalt blue design would have added visual interest to the
        room. As the lithograph shows, it would have been part of an assortment
        of functional food storage and serving pieces which might have included
        earthenware and perhaps some ironstone and pewter plates. Since the jar
        survived the next hundred years, I imagine it left his neighborhood. The
        first tenement was built in Corlears Hook in 1833 and the area soon
        became notoriously overcrowded and dangerous. Race may not have been a
        factor during this period, but class was.

        Scholar, Collector, and Museum Curator Edwin Atlee Barber Writes the
        First Encyclopedic Book on American Pottery and Mounts an Exhibition
        (1892–1893) Barber’s encyclopedic book and corresponding exhibition,
        American Art Industry: Pottery and Porcelain, mark the transition of
        American stoneware from home use to museum collections, historical
        narrative, and public display. At this spot on the map, we shift from a
        home or a private collector to considering the jar in an institutional
        context, including the influence of curatorial intent and the creation
        of knowledge. When a person of cultural authority situated the jar in a
        book and a museum, it achieved a new cultural status as an object of
        refinement, importance, and pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a volunteer curator for the newly opened Pennsylvania Museum and
        School of Industrial Art, Barber created one of the first documented
        exhibitions intent on demonstrating excellence in American ceramics. The
        museum, a precursor to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was founded on
        the site of the successful Centennial Exhibition of 1876, the first
        world’s fair held in the United States. Barber wrote the first
        encyclopedic catalog of American ceramics because he wanted to advance
        the concept of a sophisticated, and racialized, American heritage. He
        intentionally chose pottery because many of the makers were of Germanic
        and British descent, and he recounts their biographies in his text.
        Barber argued that ceramics reflected human industry, culture, and
        manners and “the artistic progress of races.” He skipped most of the New
        York stoneware potters, probably because he considered the New England
        and Pennsylvania potters more aligned with his vision of the American
        ethnographic ideal, and as descendants of the Mayflower and American
        Revolutionary War soldiers.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This construction of white American heritage was common during the era
        of American industrialization. Historian Gail Bederman wrote that
        President Theodore Roosevelt’s goal of “advancing his race and his
        nation toward a more perfect civilization” was seen as the “millennial
        mission” of white American men at the turn of the nineteenth century.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1893, a year after the peak number of lynchings of Black Americans,
        Barber wrote, “the unreasonable prejudice which has heretofore existed
        against American ceramic production is rapidly disappearing as the
        discriminating public becomes more familiar with them.”{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        It was during this period that Commeraw’s assumed racial identification
        changed from Black to white.

        The Jar on Display: Commeraw’s Jar Becomes a Historical Object
        (1916–1919)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Albert Hastings Pitkin, of Hartford, Connecticut, friend, colleague, and
        protégé of Barber, and member of the General Society of Mayflower
        Descendants and Sons of the American Revolution, spent the last 35 years
        of his life collecting and studying American pottery. He retired from
        the insurance business in 1910, at age 58, to become a curator at the
        Wadsworth Atheneum, in Hartford. He exhibited his pottery collection in
        the Morgan Museum building attached to the Wadsworth Atheneum, in what
        was likely the style of a salon, as shown in the 1895 photograph from
        the museum. As a private collector, he amassed a large collection of
        American pottery which his widow sold to museums following his death,
        preserving many important examples of ceramic history. Pitkin believed
        in “Yankee ingenuity,” American heritage, and the establishment of a
        vernacular style of pottery as physical representations of these
        constructs. These beliefs were all coded language for promoting American
        history as a white people’s history. He wrote, “the pottery made by the
        aborigines will have no consideration because it was an unglazed ware
        and because it belongs essentially to Ethnological (sic) study.” He
        described stoneware as folk pottery and defined folk as Americans with
        English and European ancestors.
      </p>

      <p>
        His sudden death in October 1916 prevented his scheduled talk on
        American pottery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met purchased a
        variety of items from his American pottery collection—including the
        Commeraw jar—in 1918, with funds from the Rogers Fund, an endowment
        created by a railroad industrialist. Seventeen of these items are on
        view in the exhibition of the permanent collection on the mezzanine of
        the American Wing, where they are displayed in glass vitrines and
        grouped by chronology and materiality.

        American Wing Opens at the Met to Teach the World about American Arts.
        There’s No Art by Black People, Except for Commeraw’s Jar The jar
        entered the Met’s collection in 1918 and became part of the American
        Wing’s founding collection—a collection that reflected a white,
        Eurocentric, aristocratic perspective. The vision for the American Wing,
        opened in 1924, was to present the history of American decorative arts
        by re-creating a series of period rooms. This focus was a risky
        proposition at the time. According to former Met curator Morrison
        Heckscher, museum leaders were unsure the public had an interest in
        American decorative arts, but the Arts and Crafts movement, the Colonial
        Revival, and the “perceived need to introduce immigrants to the nation’s
        past” convinced them to forge ahead. They didn’t plan to add paintings
        because the museum donors, trustees, and directors couldn’t imagine a
        time when paintings by American artists would be considered
        museum-worthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The design of the new wing presented navigation and access problems from
        the start, and a succession of curators, directors, architects, and
        consultants worked on a series of redesigns that culminated in 2012.
        This focus on making the massive, expensive new wing more functional may
        explain why no one at the Met discovered more about Thomas Commeraw’s
        biography or curated any new exhibitions involving American stoneware
        until 2021, nearly 100 years after acquiring the jar.{" "}

      <h3>
        Colonial Nostalgia Sweeps the Nation during the Bicentennial.
        Definitions of Whose Art and Whose History Expand
      </h3>
      <p>
        During the years surrounding the American Bicentennial, Americans looked
        toward tradition to understand their national values. A nostalgia
        permeated a lot of the culture, perhaps as a reaction to the social and
        political upheaval of the 60s and early 70s. The bicentennial generated
        a renewed interest in history. The Met launched a traveling exhibition,
        The World of Jefferson and Franklin, which did not include Commeraw’s
        jar, nor did it challenge or expand the narrative of American history in
        any significant way. However, there was an increased interest in art by
        self-taught artists, in local histories, and in the expansiveness of the
        definition of American history. The nation’s first museum dedicated to
        Black history, the African American Museum, opened in Philadelphia. In
        1980, Howard Zinn published his groundbreaking A People’s History of the
        United States. Commeraw’s jar remained at the Met, either in storage or
        in a pottery vitrine, and amateur collectors began collecting
        utilitarian stoneware for their own study and enjoyment.

      <h3>
        Commeraw’s Work Starts Appearing in Folk Art and Antique Guides Aimed at
        Collectors
      </h3>
      <p>
        Commeraw’s jar appears in American Wing guides through the years, but
        other pieces of his appear in folk art guides written for collectors
        starting in 1959 and peaking in the 1980s. These guides offered cheery,
        practical advice for the novice collector who wanted to consult an
        expert source before plunking down several hundred dollars on a find.
        For these collectors, the value of American stoneware depended on the
        decoration of the pot. Since these pots were mass-produced, makers
        repeated their marks, even using stencils and stamps to expedite the
        process. But occasionally they hand-incised a decoration, like the
        floral sprigs on the Commeraw pot, or something more complicated, like a
        bird, an eagle, or a multi-masted ship. Maker names were less important,
        though guides educated buyers on how to decipher pottery marks. Pottery
        from Bennington, Vermont, commanded a premium—the same potteries Pitkin
        and Barber wrote about and museums collected at the beginning of the
        century. Collectors Anthony and Barbara Zipp started their auction house
        in 1983, selling American functional pottery, including many Commeraw
        pieces.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Folk art guides offered a transactional approach to stoneware and
        acknowledged the passion of collecting—two things not positioned as
        appropriate for the public in museum exhibitions. These guides shared a
        commonality with Crolius’s advertisement of 1809: they included prices.{" "}

        Curators Continue to Create American Stoneware Exhibitions Centering a
        Narrative of a White Western-European Heritage
      </h3>
      <p>
        Commeraw’s jar was not included in the 1980 guide to the newly
        refurbished American Wing, and I can’t confirm whether the jar was on
        view or in storage. The brief mention of American stoneware in the guide
        gives a clinical description of the making process, using passive
        language which nearly eliminated the presence of the maker. The short
        section begins, “Stoneware, made of finer and denser clays that were
        fired at a much higher temperature than ordinary earthenware, was
        produced as early as the eighteenth century.” There’s a small, dark,
        black and white photo of a jug by one of Commeraw’s contemporaries, John
        Crolius, Jr.
      </p>

      <p>
        This truncated, pragmatic mention of stoneware certainly shifts from
        Barber and Pitkin’s days of nation-building through a glorification of
        its craft history. Most of the guide focuses on describing and showing
        views of the many period rooms in the American Wing. Perhaps this shift
        can be attributed to the increasing popularity of folk art, which was
        not the focus of the curators of the American wing. The cover of the
        guide features the imposing marble facade of a bank branch formerly
        located on Wall Street in the early 1820s and now installed inside the
        museum, a fitting image for the Wall Street culture of New York City in
        the 1980s.{" "}

      <h3>Changing Commeraw’s Race Raises the Market Value of His Pots</h3>
      <p>
        American stoneware dealer and independent researcher Brandt Zipp is one
        of three sons in the second generation of owners of the Crocker Farm
        auction house. In 2004, while researching New York census records for
        potter Henry Remmey, Zipp discovered an overlooked notation next to
        Commeraw’s name identifying him as Black. This discovery of Commeraw’s
        racial identification stunned the pottery community, which had only
        known about enslaved potter David Drake before this point. The notation
        is easy to see in the 1810 record. Crocker Farms sold a Commeraw
        presentation jug for a record price of $96,000 in November 2021. In the
        summer of 2021, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art purchased a Drake
        jar for $1,560,000, the highest price paid for any object of American
        pottery. Interest in Commeraw’s biography has increased dramatically
        since Zipp’s discovery. The biographical exhibition Crafting Freedom:
        The Life and Legacy of Free Black Potter Thomas W. Commeraw runs January
        27–May 28, 2023, at the New-York Historical Society. It’s notable that
        it was an expert who had a financial stake in American pottery who made
        the discovery, and not a scholar or curator.{" "}

          While researchers looking for stoneware histories often cited Commeraw
          from his listings in the New York City directories, which recorded
          address and trade, they failed to find him in the census records,
          which recorded race. Or perhaps they did and just never reported it.

        Vitrines and Mezzanines. If There Are No Indicators That an Artist Is
        Non-White, White Is the Default
      </h3>
      <p>
        I visited the Met’s Commeraw jar in September 2021. The jar was smaller
        than I thought, my perception distorted from seeing photos of it
        standing alone so many times in guidebooks and on websites. Commeraw’s
        gray and blue jar perched on a two-inch creamy white plinth in a glass
        case with seven other American stoneware vessels. The sign in the upper
        left corner of the case reads, “Salt-Glazed Stoneware 1790–1860.” The
        curators are less sure it’s a Commeraw jar than they used to be,
        evidenced by the label which reads, “Thomas Commeraw (active 1797–1819)
        or David Morgan (active 1797–1802).” There is no indication of either
        potter’s race, though like all the other potters in the case, Morgan was
        white. With little biographical information, this collection of gray and
        blue stoneware pots tells a story of form, material, era, and function.
        The natural lighting is bright and even, and the spotless glass makes me
        wonder if anyone stops here. There are no guards in sight the day I
        visit, so I put my hand on the glass in front of Commeraw’s pot. I want
        my fingerprints to signal that this pot is worth a look.{" "}

      <h3>
        Commeraw Finally Leaves the American Wing and Appears in the
        Afrofuturism Room
      </h3>
      <p>
        In October 2021, museum handlers removed the Commeraw jar from its tidy
        plinth on the mezzanine and installed it on a warm wooden shelf in a
        mock living space designed as an Afrofuturist period room. The room,
        which straddles the future and the past, is a fantastical expression of
        what a home interior might look like if Seneca Village, a unique
        community of property-owning free Black people, had not been razed in
        1857 to create Central Park. Including Commeraw’s jar in this home
        setting invites viewers to consider the existence of Black craftspeople,
        the function of the jar, and its excellence of form. An analysis would
        be incomplete without considering the impact of the social justice
        movement Black Lives Matter on the Met’s exhibition plans and the press
        surrounding this show.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This exhibition finally plucks the jar from the cultural amber of the
        colonial era and challenges the visitor to interpret it through a more
        modern lens. Its size no longer seems so small when placed in a dining
        area, and its gray body and blue flourish feel less colonial when
        juxtaposed with exuberant works by living artists. The exhibition has
        its shortcomings, but for Commeraw’s jar, it’s a welcome excursion out
        of the sterile vitrine.
