        Richard “Dick” Poynor, who lived from 1802 to 1882, made these slat-back
        post-and-rung chairs <em>(Figure 1)</em> and many others like them. His
        well-practiced, simple, and light design language and tidy craftwork are
        recognized by a growing number of collectors and museums.

        His chairs can be distinguished by their lathe-turned legs and back
        posts, which are curved backward to support good lumbar posture, shaved
        flat above the seat, and carved into rounded mule ears at the tops. The
        back slats are pegged in place with a visible pin through the top slat.
        The joinery of the rungs is hidden, and no Poynor chair has been
        recorded to come apart at these seams. His chairs often make use of
        maple for the posts, hickory for the rungs, and split oak for the woven
        seat.

        Although Poynor was a prolific maker, only scant oral history and the
        woodwork—including hundreds of chairs—remain as record of his processes.
        Scant details, such as that he is known to have used a horse-powered
        lathe in his chair factory, have been written into the record from oral
        history.

        His chairs are both exceptional, in their longevity and pleasant
        composition, and typical, in that they are stylistically and
        functionally similar to chairs made by many other chairmakers. To
        support this duality, I studied the lineages of craftspeople, functional
        design, and lifestyle that Poynor’s chairs, and his life circumstances,
        represent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poynor was born enslaved in 1802, in Halifax, Virginia, to Robert
        Poynor, who likely taught him the trade of chairmaking.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-3">3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        In 1816, Robert, with his family and a retinue of enslaved laborers
        (children and adults, fractured segments of families), moved to Leiper’s
        Fork, Tennessee, where they continued farming tobacco and cotton, doing
        masonry work, and making chairs.
        <sup>

      <p>
        To these settlers, Tennessee was “the backcountry,” and migration to the
        area meant homesteading to reproduce the plantation lifestyle that
        previous generations had established in Virginia and North Carolina,
        using methods which had farmed the soil there to a state of nutrient
        depletion.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-5">5</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        In this way, families tried to “re-create and perpetuate networks of
        friendship and extended family in their new backcountry homes.”
        <sup>

        Historian Lisa Tolbert has written extensively about Tennessee and the
        town of Franklin around the time of Poynor’s life. In “Henry, A Slave,
        v. State of Tennessee,” she writes that the line between free and
        enslaved was more porous for African Americans living in Franklin in the
        1850s than it was for African Americans living on either plantations or
        in truly rural areas, as enslaved people in the Franklin area often
        worked for wages and had some personal freedoms. This kind of freedom
        enabled Poynor to make and sell chairs even while still enslaved to
        Robert, and to use the proceeds to purchase his freedom and that of his
        second wife, Millie.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-7">7</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        They established a home on Pinewood Road, nearby to Robert’s plantation
        and across the street from another Poynor family. That no written record
        has been found of this transaction is in line with Tolbert’s finding of
        the legal laxity of these arrangements at that time. I found records
        that Poynor’s children worked for more than one family of “white”
        Poynors, as well as other “white” planters, and were bought, sold,
        willed between generations, and served a variety of professional
        appointments in the region up to and after the time of his
        self-emancipation.

        I could find no record of Poynor’s emancipation, but the date has been
        noted as being between 1850 and 1860.

        In the advertisement “CHAIRS! CHAIRS!” which he placed for the sale of
        chairs in 1849, he claims himself to be “now ‘on my own hook,’” which
        establishes an earlier date of emancipation than I have found elsewhere.
        Poynor died soon after the second message expressing concern about his
        health was sent in 1882. In Poynor’s obituary, he is referred to as “one
        of the best-known citizens of old Williamson, and was honored by all who
        knew him, though a colored man.” The inclusion of “though” in the
        wording of his obituary seems to imply that it was written by and
        printed for a “white” audience, whereas the second part of the clause
        states that Poynor commanded “the respect of all,” indicating a wider
        audience.{" "}

        There are records of plantation- and slave-owning “white” settlers named

        There was a period of about 40 years, starting in the decade before the
        Union occupation of Franklin in 1864, when it was viable for African
        American families to live on and work the land while living free in the
        Middle Tennessee area—and they did.

        Over the course of the 1900s this changed, as Confederate-sympathizing
        locals reacted to emancipation violently and with prejudice, and African
        Americans in the area lost their land and moved away. The region is now
        renowned for its conservative values, and Williamson is the wealthiest

        Chairs of a similar style and build to Poynor’s were made, it seems, in
        every valley in Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina. Williamson

        While the basics are similar from chair to chair, the details vary
        widely. The ratios of each section to another, precise methods of
        joinery, and the shapes of the turned posts and rungs are all
        compositional specificities. These nuances define the work of an
        individual maker, hint at that maker’s lineage, and, with careful
        examination, can be tied in perpetuity to an individual as their
        creator.

        A long history of chair scholarship has tracked chairs of this general
        form, called post-and-rung, back centuries to Western Europe{" "}
        <em>(Figure 6)</em>, where migration carried the basic design across
        fluctuating borders, much as methods traveled through expanding
        communities settled in the US in the eighteenth and nineteenth
        centuries. The painting from sixteenth-century Germany shows a carved
        post-and-rung chair. These more rustic chairs, which were produced in
        New Jersey at the end of the eighteenth century, are made with staves
        and square-edged wood stock, and the mortises (or holes) are bored all
        the way through the vertical posts to capture the rungs. In this chair,
        the staves are shaped by shaving, which makes for stock that more
        closely follows the grain of the wood. Turning the posts into perfect
        cylinders on a lathe, as Poynor did, is a further step of refinement
        that requires a machine, and which works best with carefully selected,
        straight-grained wood.

        Historian Rick Warwick has been studying Poynor’s chairs for decades.
        Much of what I have been able to learn about Poynor’s chairs, I have
        found in his work. Warwick has made note of the fact that he has never
        encountered a chair of Poynor’s where one of the connections between
        post and rung has failed, and the joint did not come apart even when he
        used a car jack to try to break it.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-21">21</a>
        </sup>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Warwick’s speculations about the chair’s joinery and fabrication
        processes led me to research green woodworking, and I found that there
        has been a revival of these methods, led by green woodworkers Jennie
        Alexander and Peter Follansbee, over the past 20 years.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-22">22</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        In Alexander’s method, the leg posts, front and back, are carved from
        green wood, and the rungs are heat-dried, cured, and hardened after
        shaping. The chair is assembled while the posts are still wet, and so
        the mortise into which the rungs fit shrinks as the wood dries,
        permanently capturing the rungs. This is the same mechanism for
        fastening chairs together that Warwick describes Poynor as having used.
        The rungs on a well-made chair like this also interlock with each other
        in the joint, at right angles captured in the green wood{" "}
        <em>(Figure 7)</em>. There are now many modern makers producing
        Alexander’s design, which is styled differently than Poynor’s chairs,
        but uses the same reliable, expert, joinery methods.{" "}

        Poynor made chairs that were exceptional. Their longevity and growing
        value as antiques are a testament to their durability and simple
        elegance. All the more impressive: even though he worked using standard
        conventions and styles for his region and era, and lived a life
        well-connected to many in the wider region, with neighbors who spent
        their time in very similar ways to how he spent his, Poynor’s chairs
        still manage to stand out. The design of these chairs was not an
        innovation, but they are excellently crafted with recognizable
        character. Although little has been recorded about the personal details
        of his life, much remains of his work, and of the respect it garnered.{" "}

        who they enslaved were often, or even usually, direct relatives—the

        and Black people as definitionally separate. These scare quotes are a
        way to acknowledge both that this is an outdated and unrealistic albeit
