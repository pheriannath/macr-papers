        There was a subversive potential to focusing my practicum research on
        the contributions of Black craftswomen. In July 2019, when I began
        researching Black craft histories, the dominant narratives within craft
        studies were Eurocentric histories that documented predominately white
        artists and makers. Due to these limited perspectives, there was a
        palpable scarcity of Blackness within craft, specifically in the absence
        of Black craftswomen. Furthermore, I wanted to focus on the upper South,
        including the Southern Appalachian Mountains, as a geographical area of
        reference, to refute assumptions that this area was without a Black
        craft history.{" "}

        A formative moment in developing this work was the research I conducted
        during my first year in the Master of Arts Critical Craft Studies
        program. For my final paper in Craft and History 1, I wrote an essay
        titled “A Note about Black Craftspeople in the Southern Appalachian
        Mountains,” which attempted to raise questions about the absence of
        documentation and preservation of African American Appalachian craft
        histories and narratives from 1855 to 1922. For me, this examination
        unveiled Black identities within craft, which extended an invitation for
        me to evoke a more studious response and dive deeper into Black craft
        studies.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon returning for the second semester of the program, I narrowed my
        focus to pursuing research on the lives of Black craftswomen from
        enslavement and beyond emancipation. I found it to be most necessary
        that I explore the contributions of craftswomen, given that in general
        the historic representation of Black women was even less regarded than
        that of Black men. Enslaved craftswomen did not get nearly the same
        recognition as Black craftsmen such as furniture maker Thomas Day and
        potter David Drake (Dave the Potter). Thus, I set forth on the path to
        writing and researching for my practicum paper, which culminated with
        “In the Fray: Black Women and Craft, 1850–1910.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>

      </p>

      <p>
        When researching and writing “In the Fray,” I examined craft through the
        lens of skilled craftswomen, centering on Black women who lived between
        1850 and 1910, and looking specifically at the change from craftswomen
        being enslaved to craftswomen being free women entering into
        institutionalized education. Through this frame, I analyzed the
        relationship between craft and Black life to illuminate how craft is
        intertwined in African American history. Craft was a fundamental
        component of Black women’s identity before, during, and after the Civil
        War in the upper South.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I re-contextualized enslaved women’s labor within craft discourse by
        providing a sample of the thousands of accounts that told the stories
        and experiences of enslaved seamstresses in the upper American South.
        Interpreting the forced labor on the plantation demonstrated how, apart
        from fieldwork, the labor of enslaved women was a network of craftwork.
        These women were textile practitioners who produced goods such as soaps,
        apparel, and all functional textiles goods for their enslavers and the
        general population of the plantation: from pillows to mattresses, from
        rugs to blankets, from coats to socks. The analysis of apparel
        production and home goods made evident that enslaved labor was based on
        skill and mastery of materials.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I suggested that, as free women, Black women did not
        abandon their crafts; rather, they continued to exemplify their artistry
        through the development of institutionalized Black education, which was
        deeply embedded in craft education. Vocational training reinforced craft
        practices in the curricula taught to young Black women at industrial and
        normal school institutions, which primarily focused on domestic training
        skills such as sewing, basketry, and dressmaking.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most intriguing aspects and a constant theme I saw in my
        research was the transmission of craft knowledge, from slavery to
        emancipation, to freedom and beyond. During enslavement, the transition
        of craft knowledge from mother to child often took place during the
        evening, when enslaved women were making essentials and textiles for
        themselves and their families. While spinning and weaving or preparing
        dinner during the evening “free time,” many women transmitted
        genealogical information and socialized their children through the
        telling of stories and intergenerational oral histories. Children often
        held candles so the women could see as they spun the carded cotton and
        wool into thread for sewing clothing, or worked on other materials in
        the manufacture of household textiles. A great example of this is
        Lucindy Lawrence Jurdon, born enslaved in Macon, Georgia, in 1858.{" "}

        An example of the transmission of knowledge is also present during the
        post-Reconstruction era of Jim Crow. In a case study of a Hampton
        Institute graduate, we are provided an example of a Black woman who
        demonstrates a life after having received a craft education. One female
        Hampton Institute student—whose name I, unfortunately, could not
        find—graduated in 1885, taught for a year in Georgia, and then returned
        to Hampton, Virginia, where she married a Hampton alumnus. They built a
        home on the same street where the Hampton Institute was located. In an
        effort to help her neighborhood, she held weekly courses in her home,
        teaching young women enrolled at Hampton how to cook and sew.{" "}

      <p>
        My research for “In the Fray” was a turning point in my relationship to
        craft and my identity as a Black woman. When I speak of my practicum, I
        am often reminded that if the research that you need is not available,
        you have to write it yourself. I wish that I had been presented with the
        knowledge of Black craftswomen as an integral part of American craft
        history much earlier in life, and I hope that my research will be a
        reference for others.{" "}
