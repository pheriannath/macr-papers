        To examine the thinking and writing that the MACR program generated and
        inspired at different points during its existence, we commissioned
        writing from two students who both encountered the absence of Black
        histories in archives. Their experiences compelled them to navigate
        these silences and influenced their paths to address these erasures in
        distinct ways.{" "}

        Mike Hatch (MACR ’20) tells the story of how the exhibition he curated
        for his MACR final project inadvertently perpetuated the erasure of
        Black craft histories. These reflections examine the impact of
        institutionalized racism and how erasure becomes calcified in the
        archive, leading to persistent absences for subsequent researchers.
        Hatch now has another view of his own responsibility in creating
        knowledge and shares how he might respond today. Hatch’s experience
        influenced his decision to continue his postgraduate research on the
        lives of Black craftspeople in Western North Carolina.

        Mellanee Goodman (MACR ’21) provides her insight and personal response
        to her experience researching Black craftswomen for her final practicum
        in the MACR program. As a Black woman, Goodman says this research feels
        personal to her own sense of identity. Her practicum project and ongoing
        research bring the labor and skill of Black craftswomen into view:
        Goodman inserts Black makers, lives, and voices into archives that for
        so long have only included white histories. She pinpoints craft as
        identity, adding stories of Black women and craft in the upper South
        from 1850–1910 to the historical record as a method of countering acts
        of erasure.

        Although Hatch and Goodman both dealt with archival absences around
        Black craft histories, they responded in distinct ways: Hatch realized
        his responsibility in contributing to erasure, where Goodman felt her
        own power to make knowledge. Both of them continue to work on telling
        these overlooked stories. As these reflections show, Black craft is
        omnipresent in history, despite repeated insistence that there was no
        such capital-C Craft within the capital-A Archive.
