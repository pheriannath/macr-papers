        What was it about the pedagogical design and ideology of the MACR
        program that proved so generative for researching and writing about
        Black craftspeople and their work and craft practices? To answer this
        question, we interviewed two people who had a tremendous impact on
        shaping the program and the environment that led to this thought and
        research: MACR director, founder, and professor Namita Gupta Wiggers,
        and public historian, founder of the Black Craftsperson Digital Archive
        (BCDA), and visiting professor Dr. Tiffany Momon.

        We begin this publication where the program began, with Wiggers. She
        discusses her commitment to a decolonizing approach of craft studies and
        traces the program’s engagement with Black craft. Wiggers envisioned
        creating a craft history and theory program that centered craft and
        craftspeople in the ways she was encountering them as the director and
        chief curator of the Contemporary Museum of Craft, but not seeing in
        critical craft scholarship. As this interview reveals, much of the
        program’s pedagogy comes from Wiggers’s emphasis on decolonization, her
        prioritization of active questioning, and her approach to layering
        content and experiences, influenced by her curatorial background.

        Upon joining the MACR faculty, Dr. Momon brought ways to facilitate and
        contextualize research and writing about Black craft and Black
        craftspeople. Her influence can be found in every contribution in this
        publication, as a workshop professor, visiting faculty, and mentor. In
        her interview, Momon explains her approach to researching Black craft
        and Black craftspeople within an archive system that preserves mostly
        white histories. She talks about reading against the grain of the
        white-based scholarship and how she teaches this to her students. She
        also reflects on her experience as a faculty member in the MACR program
        and what she sees as its impact.{" "}

      <p>
        Our conversations with Wiggers and Momon focus on how their approaches
        to craft scholarship signal a disruption to the discourse within craft
        scholarship. Understanding their pedagogical ideology, methods, and
        hopes for a future of craft discourse helps elucidate how the MACR
        program emerged and responded to the needs of a shifting craftscape and,
        in turn, inspired work on Black craft.
