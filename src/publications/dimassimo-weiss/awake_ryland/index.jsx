        <span className="speaker">Charlie Ryland:</span> The Appalachian
        ladderback chair is one of the most ubiquitous, if under-appreciated,
        forms of American furniture. If you have visited a flea market or
        vintage goods dealer with any sizable collection of furniture, you
        almost certainly have come across one. Despite their near-universal
        presence in the US, however, there is very little written about these
        chairs or their makers. Instead, the woodworking and “fine” furniture
        field has chosen to focus its historical work almost exclusively within
        the world of wealth and power, celebrating styles named after the
        monarchs and elites who favored them. Ladderbacks, like the reproduction
        Poynor chair above, have only recently garnered interest through craft
        revivalist strains tied to the back-to-the-land movement of the late
        1970s. This new interest, however, offers a truncated history of the
        form, focusing narrowly on hand-tool production techniques that
        emphasize a type of industrious individualism and homespun authenticity.
        While many of these tools, techniques, and narratives do reflect aspects
        of early ladderback development and production, much of the technology
        and history that allowed for the staggering pace of ladderback chair
        production in early America tells a different story.

        <span className="speaker">Robell Awake:</span> There is a lot of
        romanticization of process in green woodworking, and the idea that the
        more hand tools you use, the more authentic a craftsperson you are. I
        love using hand tools—it’s what got me interested in furniture-making in
        the first place. But I’m also trying to make a living running a business
        making and selling chairs. It takes me twice as long to make a chair
        using only hand tools.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In our research, we learned that the Poynors seemed focused on
        production and the agency it afforded them as enslaved craftspeople in
        the antebellum South. They invented the only known and documented
        horse-powered lathe to speed up production and shared this technology
        with other chairmakers in the area. It made them incredibly prolific in
        this pre-industrial period. This fact has really liberated me from
        anxieties I had around authenticity, especially in our late-stage
        capitalist society that makes craft an increasingly less viable way to
        make a living. This picture is a jig I came up with to speed up drilling
        holes for the rungs of the chair.

        <span className="speaker">CR:</span> At least three generations of
        Poynors, starting with Richard, worked to pioneer the production of
        ladderback chairs in central Tennessee throughout the nineteenth
        century. Their shift from straight-backed, fully rounded posts to the
        “mule-eared” rear post—slightly bent and with a flat relief cut carved
        into the upper front portion of the post—aligns with the earliest
        examples of such design details, suggesting influential early adoption
        at the very least, or even a potential point of origin. Records show
        that the Poynors innovated not only designs, but also technologies and
        processes that allowed far greater rates of production than pure
        hand-tool construction methods could, further cementing their influence
        on the form.

      <p>
        <span className="speaker">RA:</span> This is another jig I designed and
        made to expedite the mortising of the back slats. The quicker I can get
        through drilling and mortising the joinery, the quicker I can get to
        hand carving the back slats, weaving the seat, and making more chairs.
        Expediting the parts of chair-making that are more tedious allows me to
        focus my time and work on the unique and more artistic aspects of the
        chair, like the carving and seat weaving. The reality is that the faster
        I can make chairs, the more affordable and accessible they become for
        people to purchase, which is the ultimate goal for me. Everyone has
        their own calculus for striking that balance between efficiency and
        handmade-ness, and the Poynor story and their incredibly well-made,
        artistic, and prolific practice has informed my personal calculus. I
        want my chairs to be used and loved by everyday people, and, in order to
        do so, certain parts of the process have to be expedited by machine use.{" "}

        <span className="speaker">CR:</span> Pieces like the kid’s chair above
        were used everywhere, cherished even among the area’s wealthy plantation
        owners, and kept well after parts were worn through with regular, rough
        use. The flats worn onto the front posts of this chair likely came from
        repeated use by the family’s children as they pushed it across the floor
        while learning to walk, a literal example of the fundamental support
        role these chairs and their makers played in the reproduction of
        society. Although these chairs were so strongly associated with the
        Poynors during the nineteenth century that they were known in the region
        simply as “Poynor chairs,” and their mule-eared variation remains one of
        the most popular ladderback forms today, nearly all trace of the Poynor
        influence has been erased from the histories.

        <span className="speaker">RA:</span> A finished chair (inspired by the
        Poynor form as well as Ethiopian chairmaking traditions). The story of
        the Poynor family and their lack of inclusion in the period-furniture
        canon, or the green woodworking revival in recent years, highlights the
        intersection of racial and class erasure that reflects America’s age-old
        colonial project and the mythmaking that undergirds it. The green
        woodworking community extols the working-class virtues that the
        ladderback chair represents, but they do so while simultaneously
        ignoring the enormous debt this style of chairmaking owes to the Poynor
        family. This particular style of chair, the mule-eared ladderback, is
        the most popular version of a ladderback today. In the nineteenth
        century, it was called a Poynor chair. Today, it’s known by other names,
        none of which are those of the family that popularized if not invented
        the style. The myths about who has made furniture can be just as real a
        barrier to Black folks pursuing a life in craft as the financial
        obstacles of getting started and the whiteness of the field as a whole.
        Combating these erasures by reclaiming this style of chair as a “Poynor”
        chair has become an essential part of my artistic practice.
