        What happens when craftspeople who both know how to make things and know
        how to write things research the same subject? Three experienced
        woodworkers wrote the following two pieces about craftsman Richard
        Poynor and his ladderback chairs. Their historical analysis and
        furniture-making knowledge amplify our understanding of an
        underrecognized Black craftsperson’s practice and process.{" "}

        In her essay on Dick Poynor and his family, Miriam Devlin (MACR ’23)
        underscores the relative ease of exploring the design and history of
        chairs, compared to the difficulty of locating records on the Poynor
        family themselves. Devlin addresses this dearth of knowledge by
        researching how the world around the Poynors shaped their lives and
        their work as Black craftspeople. Additionally, her analysis of what
        makes these chairs unique testifies to her background in construction,
        woodworking, and her material knowledge.{" "}

        Independent researchers and furniture-makers Robell Awake and Charlie
        Ryland presented their work-in-progress on researching and re-creating
        chairs built by Poynor during the summer 2022 MACR residency. In the
        following photo essay, Awake and Ryland document the moments in
        chair-building that illuminate the innovations within Poynor’s
        woodworking. Through this hands-on approach, they come to understand the
        nuances of Poynor’s decision-making process, not just his making
        process.

        Both these essays come from the perspectives of makers and builders,
        using two distinct research methodologies to understand the Poynors’
        techniques and lived experiences as skilled craftspeople. These pieces
        dovetail to show how different perspectives on the same topic illuminate
        the dimensionality of Black craftwork: a single chair can be seen,
        analyzed, made, and understood from different angles.
