        The contributions in this section reflect the criticality that MACR
        students bring to writing about makers and their work. Both of these
        essays started from research conducted in Tiffany Momon’s History and
        Theory 1 class on Black craftspeople. The ways of thinking also reflect
        Momon’s pedagogical impact on the program, in the ways students read
        against the grain, use unconventional sources, and seek out the presence
        of Black makers.{" "}

        In her essay, Jill DiMassimo (MACR ’23) follows the path of a stoneware
        jar from raw clay to a gallery in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her
        work points to how separating the identity of the Black craftsman who
        made the jar prevents us from getting a fuller picture of the work and
        its historical context. In this case, there is an interesting twist in
        the connection between racial identity and craft object, preservation
        and attribution. For over 125 years, curators and collectors
        misidentified Thomas Commeraw as white, his true racial identity as a
        Black man obscured not by an archival oversight, but by racist
        assumptions.

        In an essay on Black and Ojibwe sculptress Edmonia Lewis, Jennifer Hand
        (MACR ’23) explores the link between Black craft and Indigenous craft
        practices in the tourist economy, a unique dynamic of influence that
        informed Lewis’s sculpture. Hand’s research brings forth matrilineal
        traditions and communal teaching practices, connecting Lewis to a
        storied legacy of craftwork that has previously gone unexamined. This
        writing presents the sculptress as a craftsperson amid other thinkers
        and makers who shared her background and experience, rather than an
        artist working in isolation due to her race.

        These essays point out places where institutional bias has obstructed
        the ability to imagine a more fully realized story of Black craft. By
        centering the connection between objects and makers, these writers
        underscore the presence of Black craftspeople whose stories had been
        there all along.
