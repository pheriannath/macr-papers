        Justin Den Herder is a structural engineer, educator, and poet. Our
        conversation started out as a crash course in what structural
        engineering is and how it differs from architecture (he describes it as
        designing the skeleton of a building—the bones that keep it standing),
        but it quickly turned into a discussion about how experiencing space on
        the page of a printed poem is similar to experiencing the space of a
        building. He also talked about how the connectivity of a forest is a
        perfect model of the ecological potential of a built environment. The
        underlying theme that ran through our conversation was connection, and
        understanding how embedded the business of buildings is within social
        and environmental issues. Most people do not see the world through such
        an interdisciplinary lens, and therefore are not always aware of the
        connections he sees. At multiple points in our conversation, Den Herder
        posed the question, "ought we build it?"— a query that he keeps at the
        front of his mind in order to consider how a new building might impact
        the communities that will surround it. Den Herder knows that his
        perspective of structural engineering is relatively unique, which
        concerns him because without other people in the field understanding or
        acknowledging the political power of buildings, working toward more
        equitable and sustainable futures in urban areas is slower and harder.
        As a structural engineer, he necessarily operates as one piece of a much
        larger system; making significant shifts in it would require many other
        parts of the whole to also adopt his perspective, but as an individual,
        any small change he can make to challenge the system is a worthy
        rebellion. While Robin Wall Kimmerer was not encouraged to explore
        science outside of western conventions while in school, Den Herder tries
        to impart a sense of connectivity to his architecture and engineering
        students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in order to get them to
        think collaboratively and relationally about the built environment.

      <p>*</p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">Beryl Perron-Feller:</span> Can you start by
        just talking a little bit about what you do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Justin Den Herder:</span> Yeah, so I work
        professionally as a structural engineer. And my family, I think, still
        believes I'm an architect. That's not uncommon. Essentially I like to
        describe [structural engineering] as designing the skeleton for a
        shelter. And shelters can take many different varied forms. Often, I
        feel like structural engineers are doing their best job when you don't
        notice the structure at all. I love seeing the structure of a building
        expressed because it's a physical manifestation of the laws of physics
        that we're kind of holding at bay to allow something to happen within a
        space. Structural engineering is like being, not the lead singer, but
        you're kind of like the bassist or the drummer. You'd probably be
        hard-pressed to know one famous structural engineer. I'm totally fine
        with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's kind of a scary profession in the sense that when structural
        engineering is in the news, it's usually because something terrible has
        happened. So the profession is built around maintaining public safety.
        And as building materials have evolved to hold more load, the job
        becomes increasingly more technical, creating the need for it to be a
        niche profession within the industry of the built environment, which is
        fairly new, like within 100 years. Prior to that, historically there was
        the concept of the master builder or master architect who was intimately
        familiar with building construction and building materials and therefore
        was well-versed in its applications and limitations. So structural
        engineering is a nascent sort of profession within the industry.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> And I'm guessing that there are
        more roles than just architects and structural engineers involved in the
        built environment. What are some of the other roles on the team?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I would say even the simplest box
        that you can try and build in New York City, there's probably 1,000
        people who touch that project to actually make it happen in accordance
        with building codes and so forth. That includes primarily three groups
        of people. You have the client that's defining the need or desire, then
        there's the design team, of which the architect is the ringleader.
        Structural engineers play a pivotal role because, well, buildings need
        to stand up in order to serve a function. But there are many other
        engineers and designers who come into play in most projects: Mechanical
        engineers designing the ventilation, the plumbing, the electrical
        systems, the ductwork [are] major player[s]; lighting, interior design,
        or landscape design; these days environmental consultants are becoming
        part of the picture more frequently, too. And then you have the general
        contractor and construction manager who are liaising with the architect
        and the owner, and will also have subcontractors, like the iron workers
        and the steamfitters. So the clients, the architect, and the contractor
        are the Trinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most things in this world, it's a very complex web. And I've come
        to care more and more about what we're working on, as opposed to just
        the technical challenge of getting something done. Ultimately, the real
        question is, "ought we be building something or not?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love to think that even if structural engineers are sort of
        secondary players in this whole group of people, that by doing good
        projects, ethical projects that are better for the whole rather than an
        individual with money, for example, that can be part of a sustainable
        and resilient business plan. How to go about that? It's very, very
        difficult.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Yeah. Especially when you can't do
        it alone. You can't just be one single vigilante structural engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I've dreamed about that and just
        having that sense of control over what I can or can't do. I've been at
        the firm that I currently work at for long enough that I feel like I
        could say "no" if I was morally opposed to a particular project. I don't
        want to necessarily romanticize the culture of the office that I'm in,
        but I do appreciate the space to have these conversations. At least
        there is some sense of agency, even if I'm part of a larger corporation,
        right? But it takes a lot of communication and difficult conversations
        to even get to the point where you feel bold enough to suggest something
        like that. Ultimately, that space doesn't mean too much if it can't turn
        into some form of tangible change, even if it's incremental. The whole
        industry can't change overnight, but I guess I am interested in being
        rebellious to the point that it at least brings about some sort of
        incremental change.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What does it mean to be rebellious
        as a structural engineer?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> That is a funny question because
        the stereotype is that engineers aren't necessarily great at
        communicating. They're more analytical minds that just want to be
        solving a technical problem. We need people who are technically
        proficient in order to keep the built environment safe, but I realized
        that no one was really asking bigger questions about why and for whom we
        are being technically proficient—or, at least, that it wasn't part of
        the public discourse within the profession. I don't think there are a
        lot of people talking like that within the industry. So I see operating
        from that position of genuine interrogation about the end result of our
        buildings and who they serve as a gap that can be filled.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What kind of role or specific set
        of knowledge do you feel should be represented more in the process of
        commissioning, designing, or physically building a building that isn't
        currently?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> The most obvious answer to me is
        community engagement. There's this problem of a single building living
        within a bigger urban context that doesn't ask, "what are the needs of
        the broader urban setting?" For example, is a super-tall, luxury
        condominium building in Midtown serving the city in any way? I think the
        answer is resoundingly no. It's essentially an empty safe deposit box in
        the sky, for a corporation or for a very small number of ultra-wealthy
        people. Those are the questions that we really need to be asking as a
        profession and as a society, because it's our collective tax money that
        goes to these things, too. So even if you know nothing about
        architecture or structural engineering, you can influence where the
        funding is going if you're engaged in our public policy making. What
        gets built is a reflection of how society thinks and what its interests
        are. Which is frightening if, like me, you don't want to be building
        more high-rise luxury condos. But there is hope if we engage with how
        budgets are being established, and protest when things are getting built
        that we don't think should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        To construct a new building, you need the engagement of the community
        and the people who will use that space day in and day out, and not in a
        false or disingenuous way, just to check a box or produce the illusion
        of community engagement. I mean community engagement in a true
        altruistic, open-hearted way that hears the concerns of the people who
        live in a neighborhood or live in a particular building. What solutions
        do they want? It could be anything from social and affordable housing to
        what use a library serves within a community. I've been fortunate to
        work on a lot of public library projects and it's pretty interesting to
        see how the notion of what a library is has evolved even over the last
        decade and a half. Libraries used to be places filled floor to ceiling
        with books, and I do still think the physical book is an important
        aspect of what it means to be a library and give people access to
        physical books, but the notion of a library has become more of a social
        gathering space, a place for community-based educational programs. A
        library is a bastion of liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think there's still a lot collectively that we're learning about how
        to create a city that is beneficial for most of its citizens. So when
        there's funding coming to a particular neighborhood for a new library or
        renovated library space, get involved and understand what the funding
        mechanisms are and what kind of services can be provided by that
        library. I think libraries are a good example of having community
        engagement in the building industry. We all have some level of either
        complicity or agency to bring about change, there's always this
        individual to collective relationship that is a recurring pattern at all
        different scales of the built environment.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> I know you teach structural
        engineering as well. What are the classes that you teach?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I teach at Rensselaer Polytechnic
        Institute (RPI), in Troy, New York. I teach three classes over the
        course of an academic year in the School of Architecture. I teach
        structural engineering to architects, which is a different context than
        teaching engineers. I essentially teach basic structures, and then
        slightly more advanced structures. Architecture students need to be
        exposed to and have learned some stuff about structural engineering
        because, ultimately, they're collaborating with structural engineers,
        and it's helpful for them to have that experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third class that I teach is an elective class that is half civil
        engineering students and half architecture students. For now I've called
        the class The Art of Structures, and it's a bit more of a freewheeling
        class because it has more to do with answering the question "ought we
        build something" rather than "can we build something." It's a mixture of
        those ideals and learning how to collaborate with each other. An
        architect's primary role these days is chief collaborator as the
        ringleader of the design team, but there's very little about how to
        collaborate built into Architectural or Structural Engineering
        curricula.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gear most of my classes toward developing a broad understanding of
        structural systems and when they're appropriate or not, which seems to
        me like a thing that architects really need to know. Having been a civil
        engineering student myself, no one said a word about how to collaborate,
        or justify a design to somebody. It was always: here's a technical
        problem, there's one ideal solution, and it's the most efficient one.
        And then when you get into practice, you realize that you are the one
        creating the homework problem and then solving it, but there isn't
        always one right answer like in a homework problem. Nowhere in the
        engineering curriculum that I've encountered personally is anybody
        teaching engineers how to collaborate as part of a broader team, so I
        try to bring some of that to this class in a project-based setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like teaching because it feels like a way of giving back, but also a
        way to, if I can be so bold, positively influence the next round of
        designers; the designers who have to deal with a lot of challenges that
        current and recently past society is foisting upon this younger
        generation of designers. Like, what does it mean to design a new
        building when we're already experiencing massive climate change?
        Building construction and operation contributes to 40% of anthropogenic
        global carbon emission. It's an enormous number. And at the same time,
        the population is continuing to increase and there's a need to build. A
        lot of people are homeless and can't afford homes. So there's a need to
        build.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> But we were also talking earlier
        about those big developer buildings that just stay empty, which
        perpetuates more people becoming homeless, so building more buildings
        seems to make more people homeless, not more people housed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> That's right. That's why we need
        to change, that's what we need to change. It's heartbreaking, it really
        is, and I'm not blameless in this either. I've worked on structurally
        ambitious projects for individuals or institutions with unfathomably
        deep pockets. Several of those projects will essentially be sculptures
        in Atlantis within 50&mdash;75 years. How I justify being part of
        projects like those is a very real concern of mine, one that weighs on
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I try to think about it is that I can use the money made off of
        that project to perhaps design projects that serve those in need. But I
        also worry that that's just a fanciful idea, because the reality is that
        any profit that we make within the context of working for a corporation
        goes into a big bucket, but I do try and track the profits made from
        projects with wealthier clients in my own way, and actively seek out a
        diverse range of projects. The right of refusal to projects is something
        that is super important to me. But I know that if I don't take on a
        particular project another structural engineer will, and the project
        will still get built. It's a real challenge that I grapple with and
        don't know how to solve.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> I hear an awareness of
        interconnectedness in the way you talk about understanding that what you
        do fits into a larger context. I'm curious, is this sense of
        connectivity common in the structural engineering world at large, or is
        it just a you thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> That's a good question. I don't
        think it's common for structural engineers to think about the broader
        context of our work because it is a niche, specialized profession. It's
        difficult to kind of see the forest through the trees very well when
        you're so focused on trying to solve the problem or design challenge in
        front of you, and public safety depends on that immersed focus. And the
        pace and the speed at which the industry works these days affords very
        little time for big-picture rumination because time is money, and many
        of those in power, or with substantial wealth to fund major projects,
        don't want you to be ruminating because the current status quo serves
        their needs first and foremost.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the system is kind of inherently broken in that way, which is why I
        personally feel like even just to think on these things is a necessary
        form of rebellion. I'm interested in expanding that context, by virtue
        of things like teaching or habit of mind. I've found that poetry can
        offer new and different insights. I don't think paradigm shifts on a
        grand scale can or will occur from within the rigged, rigid setting in
        which we're currently entrenched. Poetry is born of awareness and
        intention. In this way, everybody is a poet to some extent, whether they
        are physically writing poems or not. For awareness and intention to have
        depth and heft, there needs to be time. Time for awareness and intention
        to cultivate. This feels rebellious. It feels necessary in a world where
        we operate and change at alarming speeds.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What is the difference of
        attention/awareness between poetry and prose?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I guess maybe there's more
        openness within poetry. I want to feel like it has something to do more
        with space and allowing the reader to bring their own experiences and
        draw their own wonderful connections between words that were written
        maybe decades ago or centuries ago or yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I've come to appreciate is the connection between poetry and space,
        and structural engineering and the creation of space. Because when we're
        creating structure, we're giving a building form. But space for what?
        You might say I'm a structural engineer of prose if I'm designing a dorm
        building, and it has very specific specs: we have units that are this
        wide, and they're repetitive and there's a hallway, and there's a shared
        bathroom, and blah, blah, blah. But if you're designing a library, where
        the community has input, what happens in the space, what the space looks
        like? That is what I'm after. When I say in this class, Art of
        Structures, poetic structure that merges these ideals of who's the
        building for, who gets to be part of shaping it, what happens in the
        space, and who is participating in whatever activity within that space,
        all of those ideas need to be thought about. Yeah, poetry and
        structures! Who would have known that, for me, the connection would be
        so direct?
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> How did you come about discovering
        that connection?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> We say "Do what you love" all the
        time as if you will love it unwaveringly for the rest of your life once
        you find it. That to me is just such bullshit because we are
        ever-changing, evolving human beings. What we love now may not be what
        we want or need to love a decade from now, and what happens if you love
        multiple things? What happens if those multiple loves are two very
        distinct, different things?
      </p>
      <p>
        So where I'm going with this is that I was trying to think of the things
        that I love: Structural engineering, poetry, trees, music … In the past
        I've toyed with the idea of quitting structural engineering and trying
        my hand at writing poetry full-time and trying to make a career out of
        that. And then ultimately not doing that and maybe feeling a little bit
        guilty about never having tried that because a lot of the artists I
        admire have dedicated their life to poetry or music.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for me, I enjoyed the dichotomy or diversity of varied passions or
        loves. Why choose just one? Then the question is: how can I fold one
        into the other or merge structural engineering and poetry? One day I
        just wrote down similarities between structural engineering and poetry
        and some of the things that came out of that exercise, or are still
        coming out with that exercise, are the use of minimal materials, or
        efficient use of materials, or use of materials with intention. So if
        you are designing a building and you're designing it thoughtfully,
        you're designing the right structural system, which means that you're
        using the right amount of material to create the space. Whether that's
        steel, or wood, or concrete, or any of the common building materials.
        And if you're writing a poem, you're trying to use the minimal amount of
        words possible to maximally say whatever your intention is, which can be
        a very mysterious thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I started looking at how poems are arranged on the page, and I was
        kind of like, wow, there's like a little pocket, you could just stop in
        this line and just take a seat here before you read the rest of the
        line. Buildings are a creation of space, too, where you can stop and
        take a seat and look at the building around you or think something
        completely different. Maybe it's a memory of something that happened in
        that space. Architecture and memory are very closely connected. And
        certainly poetry and nostalgia. There's a whole litany of poems that are
        nostalgia-based, and memory-based, too. So I just started pulling on
        this loose thread a little bit and then started seeing a lot more
        overlap than I would have ever imagined. I think some part of me loves
        poetry because when that moment of connection does happen it feels like
        a little salvation. I guess I'm just trying to circle around this idea
        of why reading a particular line or stanza can suddenly feel like a
        tidbit of salvation or blow open the doors of your perception to
        something totally different.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> It's something being reflected
        back to you about yourself. And I think the salvation part of that is
        not feeling alone in things that are either on your mind constantly or
        that you never even put into conscious thought that somehow resonate
        really hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I think that's really well put,
        because if you look at the various different ways that we reach for
        connection in our lives, there's always an element of union. In our
        interpersonal relationships we're often striving for a sense of
        community. Even something like office culture or sports, all of these
        things are really, if you boil it down, I think it's all just about
        connection. Yeah, the need for connection and the hope that connections
        are being established. But poetry is remarkable because it can do that
        across time and space. So can buildings.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> I'm fascinated by the way you're
        talking about how an audience of people experience poetry and
        structures/buildings, but you haven't really talked about your own
        experience as someone who creates both of those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I guess for me to respond to a
        statement like that, I feel like I need to reflect on my motivation for
        writing poetry or writing an individual poem. That's almost as ephemeral
        as the experience of reading a poem, in the sense that it changes based
        on things like my mood and the setting. Sometimes a poem just flows out
        of you, and sometimes you're intensively working through the formation
        of a thought or concept by piecing together a collage of fragments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in the mystery a poem affords; the trust that the reader
        will bring their own experiences to it and maybe will have that moment
        of connection. So I want to put as many nodes or feelers out there, like
        little connector elements. Poetry has helped me expand how I see the
        world in different diverse ways. So I want to do that for somebody else.
        And I'm not interested in being mystical and mysterious to the point of
        being obtuse, or vague, or a banner of intellectualism, but I am
        interested in it being open-hearted. Poetry has been very useful to me
        because it's allowed me to see things more mindfully or meaningfully.
        It's also about being part of a lineage of the human race that has this
        mind-blowing capacity to be able to express themselves through language
        in a written way. I almost feel like I'm wasting something if I don't
        try to express it. Maybe that's the puritanical upbringing coming in,
        but I do feel a sense of responsibility around it, too. It's not just
        for the pleasure of writing poems for myself. Because we have this
        amazing ability, I feel like I've got to delve into it a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as for buildings/structures, the experience of, say, attending the
        ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of a public library and seeing
        people enjoy and appreciate a project where you played a key role in its
        creation can be very rewarding and renew your sense of purpose.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What do you write poetry about?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> Trees are probably the dominant
        recurring theme. Trees and light, just because I kind of feel like
        that's the ultimate metaphor for these connections for me. The name of
        the book I'm working on, which my friend Katie is helping me design, is
        called Welcome Center. I feel like nature is the ultimate welcome
        center. It doesn't discriminate. Anybody can walk in a forest, even the
        people who want to cut it down can walk in a forest. I was driving on
        the highway on my way to RPI and driving up the New York State Thruway
        one morning, super early. Usually I start the drive in the dark, and
        then at some point in the trip, sunrise comes up. And it's very
        beautiful, passing through the Catskills at sunrise. I looked over and I
        saw this sign that said, "Welcome to the Catskills Region," or something
        to that effect. For some reason, in that particular moment, I was struck
        by the phrase Welcome Center. It took on a deeper meaning for me, as
        though it were a calling. Can I be a welcome center? That's what it's
        about.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What do your classes and your
        specific perspective give students that they might not get from a
        teacher teaching similar courses? And are there opportunities to work in
        your ideals or ideas about community and connectivity into your classes?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> As we said at the start of this
        conversation, hundreds, if not thousands, of people participate in the
        design and construction of a building from concept to completion. Yet,
        for centuries, we've attributed buildings to a single person. This is
        Brunelleschi's dome, Eiffel's tower, etc. I'd argue that the mason
        carving the stone and the laborer setting it are equally instrumental in
        the success of the Duomo. The team of skilled workers setting rivets in
        the tower is as vital to the physical construction of the Eiffel Tower
        as the brainchild. Attributing a building to a sole designer is a false
        notion of how buildings get made and it is a false notion that distracts
        us from designing better buildings that serve the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in the context of the classroom, I am interested in questioning the
        system that groomed and created this. I think the challenge for students
        at present is, how can you create beautiful, efficient, useful
        structures, not grandiose things that look like they want to topple
        over, but somehow don't? I have a line of students after pretty much
        every class saying, "hey, can you look at this? My architecture
        professor told me I should ask you how you would make this stand up."
        And I don't want to squash their creativity, but I also am, like, I know
        that this isn't a realistic thing to be built. Even if it physically
        could happen, the amount of material it would take to make this stand up
        in this way is unrealistic. I don't intend to sound self-righteous by
        saying this. I've arrived at this opinion having played a role in many
        such buildings, where an architectural whim dictated the need for a
        challenging structural design that required a lot more material than a
        slightly more modest form might have demanded.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that students are finding their voice and discovering and
        learning a lot of things, but the reality is, if this studio project is
        the design of a six-story public library, you're accountable to the
        public to get something built on time and on budget, or as close to it
        as possible, that serves the needs of the people. And if you're taking
        that taxpayer money, and then just putting that money into the raw
        materials of creating this form, maybe that money would be better served
        if it went to the actual number of books or computers that are in the
        space, or whatever the actual functional costs of the library might be.
        That's not to say that structurally ambitious forms of architectural
        design don't have their place in society if it's done with the right
        intention in the right setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, there is something a little bit tougher to pin down as
        a design ideal, and that is kind of the inspirational, transcendental
        kind of quality that an architectural space can create, that can afford
        better quality, when you're in the space, a sense of awe or excitement
        or possibility. Those metrics are very difficult to quantify and are a
        bit more subjective. How do you know that that's what you're creating
        until it is a habitable space that truly instills a sense of inspiration
        or awe within its occupants? So I look for those moments as a moment of
        intervention; I do appreciate the opportunity to ask the students these
        questions. Ultimately what I'm getting at is, what kind of future do we
        want to fund? To talk more about connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that forests are idealized versions of cities because of the
        many points of connection underground that link trees together. This is
        probably also true for corporations. They tend to be more like a tree
        that was planted alone in a field, whereas what we need is more
        cooperation between individuals and collections of individuals, such as
        corporations, because when corporations lose touch with the larger
        social and geopolitical context, they become a monoculture that zaps up
        all the nutrients. Corporations have little to no ecology. They are
        driven by one desire, which is to make more profit than they did the
        year prior. They can be reimagined, though. The constructs that are here
        are constructs that were imagined and implemented. There can be totally
        different ways of envisioning a world, of envisioning a structure.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> You wrote in an email that poet
        and conservationist William Merwin is someone who exemplifies the kind
        of life you want to lead. I was curious to hear more about that in terms
        of what parts of his legacy you wish to emulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> I admire all his writing, but I
        connect most with the poems he wrote later in life. He died, I think, at
        the age of 92, or something like that. And he spent the latter half of
        his life on Maui with his wife, where he bought a discarded pineapple
        plantation. And one by one planted palm trees by hand. That is now the
        Merwin Conservancy, which is like 18 acres or so of palm trees. I love
        the idea that his later poems could embody the care and stewardship he
        wrought for the land he called home in Hawaii. I believe his later poems
        do that successfully. I admire his dedication to restoring the little
        piece of land that he had and his sense of feeling at home by doing
        that. The act of care that he was physically doing for the land made its
        way into his poems. I think I can feel that in his poems.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Do you feel like you're doing a
        good job emulating that?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">JDH:</span> Gandhi once said, "My life is my
        message." That is an ideal that I strive for. I think that's an ideal
        that Merwin was reaching for as well. I don't know that I would say I'm
        successful or unsuccessful in this. On one hand, this is a very serious
        matter, we need to think profoundly about the type of life we want to
        live and do what we can to live in accordance with that. For me, at this
        point in time, I want to live altruistically, thoughtfully. I want to
        welcome new ideas, new people into my life. On the other hand, I feel
        perfection is a mirage and striving for it can be a distracting end unto
        itself. I simply want to be open-hearted, open-minded, attentive. I want
        to be able to say that the person I will be in ten years is nothing like
        the person I am now, and that I actively sought to help people while on
        that path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have much to learn in this regard. For example, I struggle with
        patience. I'm easily angered. Even, or especially, around those I love
        most. And I am surrounded by amazing people in my life! I need to delve
        deeper and do inner work to understand why that is and actively correct
        that. Life seems to me to be more of a tuning process, a process of
        refinement and metamorphosis. A large part of that "tuning" is based on
        drawing and establishing new connections, and cultivating the patience
        to allow for those new connections between ideas and people to form.
