        Much of my work in the MACR program has been looking for overlaps in my
        own practices as an educator, metalsmith, and environmental steward. My
        experience teaching at summer camps is where these various roles have
        been in closest proximity to one another, which made me excited to
        explore whether they could become one integrated practice. While craft
        studies has been a generative way to make connections among my own
        interests and beyond, I have also become interested in how keeping these
        disciplines distinct creates specific lenses through which to encounter
        the world. Through my role as an educator, encouraging kids to always
        ask why, I see the world as questions waiting to be answered; as a
        metalsmith using many different modes of fabrication, I see the world as
        things put together; and as an environmental steward committed to the
        conservation of habitats and ecosystems, I see the world as a web of
        relationships. Even though each disciplinary lens is distinct, they
        collectively contribute to how I encounter the world as a whole.

        Based on John Freeman-Moir's writing about utopia and liberatory
        education, it seems that the overlap of disciplinary lenses would give
        people a fuller, more nuanced perspective of how the world is
        interconnected, and perhaps therefore grant them more agency in moving
        through it. For Freeman-Moir, utopia is not a society without flaws, but
        rather the habit of "acting in terms of seeing the world as whole,"

        which often requires deliberate resistance to cultural norms that prefer
        to organize skills and identities into tidy, discrete boxes.

        Included in this collection are pieces of writing and interviews with
        people who encounter the world through the lenses of multiple practices:

        My interviews with Justin Den Herder, a structural engineer and poet,
        and Morgan Buckert, a cowboy-boot maker and outdoor educator, explore
        how looking through multiple lenses at once grants us a more nuanced
        perspective of the world and the ability to participate in multiple
        communities of practice. In my conversation with Den Herder, he circles
        around many ideas about community, trees, and the built environment that
        all coalesce around notions of connectivity. Buckert discusses how she
        expresses different facets of herself through her various endeavors.
        Even though she prefers to keep her practices siloed from one another,
        the lenses of her individual pursuits contribute to the way she sees the
        world as a whole.

        Botanist and decorated professor Robin Wall Kimmerer's writing overlays
        an Indigenous and artistic lens to botany, giving her a unique
        scientific perspective that is not always understood by other
        practitioners in her field. Choreographer and water + land protector
        Emily Johnson's essay uses lenses of dance, activism, trauma, and
        cultural legacy to convey complex thoughts on love. These two pieces of
        writing help me understand how an integrated perspective of the world
        can help heal our relationships to land, the communities we belong to,
        and ourselves.

        Separately these works tell the stories of individuals who are trying to
        balance multiple roles. Together they show a push and pull between
        increased agency and structural obstacles. These insights and
        conversations serve as a reminder that I am not the only one who yearns
        for connectivity and that there are many different ways to work toward
        an integrated multidisciplinary practice.
