        Morgan Buckert, a traditional cowboy boot maker living in Hailey, Idaho,
        works in the nonprofit field making camping and other outdoor
        experiences more accessible for people across economic classes. She
        juggles multiple endeavors because she is always in pursuit of a "full
        brain," which she is able to achieve by discovering the complex
        possibilities of how the undertakings might relate, even if they do not
        overlap. In our conversation I asked about her education outside of
        school. She told me about how much more math made sense to her in
        real-world situations, like calculating the volume of water needed to
        fill a pool working at the ranch she grew up on, because the results of
        correct calculations were tangible and the problem-solving process
        required an element of common sense. Math and common sense are skills
        that have factored into her other professional experiences as a
        craftsperson and fly-fishing guide. Buckert states that her multiple
        roles, in which she is often facilitating experiences for other people,
        is very similar to being a camp counselor, who often has many varied
        responsibilities including providing emotional support, managing safety,
        and teaching. Through her many interests Buckert has developed what
        education and utopia scholar John Freeman-Moir would call, "the utopian
        habit of acting in terms of seeing the world whole." In my conversations
        with both Buckert and Den Herder I recognized that their multiple
        practices give them unique perspectives. Even though Buckert keeps her
        endeavors siloed from one another, it is clear that she and Den Herder
        both understand the world around them through many layers of context via
        balancing their multiple roles.

      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">Beryl Perron-Feller:</span> How would you
        describe your education outside of school?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">Morgan Buckert:</span> I would say that two
        main things come to mind. And I've been really enthusiastically talking
        about one recently, which is math. And the other is common sense. And I
        don't know that anyone will say anything other than common sense has
        been their out-of-school experience. Math-wise, on the ranch I grew up
        on, when we filled our swimming pool for the summer, my dad would make
        us calculate how long it would take to fill the pool. So we would put
        the water in a five-gallon bucket to see how long it took to fill the
        five-gallon bucket, and then divide that by gallons and then calculate
        the capacity of the pool. And those really basic, just, like,
        applicable, applicable math is one of the reasons I love boot-making,
        'cause boot-making is a lot of math. There's not a lot of math in
        fly-fishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that way, you know, working in development is a lot of math, too.
        I'm working in Excel every day. I'm looking at budgets every day. You
        know, I'm moving numbers around a lot. And that's it. And as someone who
        dabbles in textilesâ€”I started weaving a couple years ago. And so that's
        obviously all math. Sewing is a lot of math, cooking, baking, you know,
        a lot of traditional women's work is a lot of math, which I don't feel
        like anyone is acknowledging. I'm just surrounded by math. And I think
        because of this out-of-school experience that I grew up with, I'm a math
        enthusiast. And not calculus, or physics, just, like, straight up
        geometry and regular math.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then common sense is the other thing that, especially from my
        parents, was, like, yes, you go to school, you do well in school, but
        that does not make you an educated person, or a successful person. It's
        all these other things that you learn outside of school that makes you a
        successful person. Like taking care of your car is how you become a
        successful person. How to be safe on the river and not kill your
        clients. It's how you become a successful person. How to talk to
        strangers, you know, things like that. And I did not get a good
        education, I would say, through school. I did not have good teachers in
        a rural area, in a shit school state, and feel like I'm always behind on
        that front, but I have so many life skills that I got from all of my
        out-of-school experiences, and I feel like that's what makes me a
        successful adult.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> I love the side-by-side comparison
        of math in school and math outside of school. What would you say are the
        biggest differences in how that was taught to you? And why maybe it
        worked one way versus the other way?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> I think for me tangible products
        are how I feel successful about things and how I learned things. You
        know, when I started working, when I started working in textiles, and
        then footwear and boots, seeing progress, at the end of the day, is how
        I feel good about myself. And so, filling the swimming pool, there's a
        fucking result. And the faster I can make the water go, the faster I can
        go swimming. And so memorizing your multiplication table is important,
        but there's no result at the end of that. Whereas if I figure out this
        boot pattern, I'm going to end up with a really beautiful product. And
        so, yeah, I think tangibility is the biggest difference.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> The way that math relates to
        boot-making is such a great way to be able to say, this kind of tangible
        or hands-on education is valuable. And what you get out of how you learn
        through crafts is super valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Yeah. I had no idea that weaving
        was just a lot of math, and I'm, like, why aren't we talking about this?
        All women's work is math. It just blows me away that there's so little
        scholarship that I've seen about this. A friend just sent me a podcast
        yesterday talking about women's work as math. And I just think it's so
        disrespectful that the subject has been entirely avoided, but, you know,
        when you're making a ring your pickle has to be the right mixture, or, I
        don't know, you'll melt your hand off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever it is, a lot of traditional craft is math. And even tooling
        leather, if you think about a saddle. And that's, you know, this is
        something you may have no experience with, but creating the art that's
        actually on the leather. You have to think about the Fibonacci sequence,
        and space and placement in all of these math principles to create
        something that is pleasing to the eye. If something's even a millimeter
        off, you're, like, what is wrong with this? It just doesn't look right.
        So, yeah, it's all math.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> In the vein of experience and
        learning in a hands-on way, I know that you did an apprenticeship for a
        while to do boot-making. And also, now knowing that you have this on the
        horizon to be doing boot-making full time, do you see yourself taking on
        an apprentice at any point?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Oh, yeah, I would love that. I am
        still learning. I had a grant to work with a boot-maker in Nashville in
        March of 2020. And I will now be going in June. I'd love to spend, you
        know, a good three months with someone when I'm able to go full-time.
        Because boot-making is an endless pursuit. And so I see my education as
        never-ending. I was supposed to work on a senior project with one of my
        friend's kids and teach her how to make shoes and have some sort of
        philanthropic component. And then they canceled senior projects, because
        of COVID. And then my mentor's daughter is going to be a senior next
        year, so I will probably be taking her on to teach her how to make
        boots. My studio situation is not what I would like it to be, so once I
        am full-time and have the space that I want, I would love to have an
        intern regularly and then take apprentices when I can. I think it's a
        critical part of being a traditional artist and is absolutely necessary
        to continue our craft. And I like teaching, but mostly to keep making
        going.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Is there a sense of responsibility
        in the culture of boot-making to pass that on and pay it forward?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Well, let me say yes and no. The
        apprenticeship route is the most common route to making boots. And until
        just a few years ago, a lot of boot-makers were extremely secretive with
        processes, and that's changed a little bit with Instagram and YouTube.
        And I think most importantly that has changed with the type of people
        who are getting into boot-making. I am part of a group who has gathered
        all of the female boot-makers in the world. There's 40 in the US and one
        in France. The concentration of cowboy boot-makers are in Texas, and
        they are mostly male.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoemaking in general has a long history of angry alcoholics. And I'm
        not sure how much that is a reality as much as a stereotype, but with
        this group of women boot-makers, many are under 40. And many went to art
        school. And so the dynamic has changed significantly, and I think will
        continue to change. But the passing on of knowledge through this
        traditional method has remained the way you can do it. You know,
        unfortunately, it's really hard to take on a seven-year apprenticeship,
        much less a year apprenticeship now. And so, you know, these snippets on
        Instagram, YouTube, and on phone calls are all helpful as we're growing
        our craft. But I think that one-on-one time is really crucial to being
        successful.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Yeah, I've been an apprentice and,
        I mean, that could be its own entire life of just continuing to learn
        and dig deeper. And it is really hard to set aside a chunk of your life
        to do it. So, I feel like, in itself, it's both problematic in terms of
        access, but also useful in terms of self-selecting people who are really
        serious about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Yeah, one of my favorite quotes
        from a book, I think from undergrad, is "on either end of the social
        spectrum lies a leisure class." I think it was specifically referring to
        sports, like professional football players are more likely to be from a
        lower income. And, you know, someone who is a professional skier, or I
        should say professional, someone who gets to ski every day is going to
        be on the other end.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, you know, this lower social class gets paid to perform this. It
        becomes performative. And then at the highest end there are people who
        get to ski in the morning and then bike all afternoon. And that's a very
        busy day for them. It relates to everything, really. Like with
        boot-making, you know, there are these young women who are stay-at-home
        moms and so they have the time and resources to do it, and then on the
        other end, you know, I'm by no means wealthy, but I get to do what I
        want. And anyone in between, you know, a mom who works, can't do that.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> You were telling me early in our
        conversation about having a renewed interest in your roots and ranching
        culture, which led to your interest in cowboy boots. At what point did
        you become interested in making them?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> So I was a fly-fishing guide
        through the recession, which was a terrible idea, let me tell you. And I
        had a lot of free time. And that's when my husband and I started
        gardening. You know, we were 25 and half unemployed. So we kind of
        played house. And we started gardening and I started sewing again. When
        I started sewing, when I was four, I just hated it. I always sewed
        through school with 4-H
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-1">1</a>
        </sup>
        projects and hated it. And, you know, by the time I was a senior in high
        school I never wanted to sew again. And then once I found myself with a
        lot of free time, I'm like, oh, I should sew. I quickly started making
        handbags and accessories and started selling them and needed more of a
        challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started using leather to learn how to do a little leather work. I
        found out about Penland, and I saw that there was a cowboy-boot related
        class. It wasn't making cowboy boots, but a process related to making
        cowboy boots, and it looked awesome, but I had missed the deadline to
        apply that year. And the following year, there was a sandal-making class
        at Penland. I decided to try it and see, so I applied and I got a
        scholarship to do work study. The class was awful, but I knew it was for
        me, so I went back the next year to take a shoe class and had a really
        fantastic teacher. And I was, like, yes, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took a few years of making shoes to find someone to teach me how to
        make boots. They took me on as a student and are some of my favorite
        people in the world and just totally changed my life. And here I am â€¦ I
        knew that I really enjoyed working with leather. So that math component,
        and the leather, and that you only get one shot. Once you poke a hole in
        a piece of leather, it's done. So there's a little, you know, there's
        always terror. And then coming home and wearing shoes that I made. And
        people are, like, oh, your shoes are cute! And I'm, like, well, I made
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have friends who thought I just designed them and got them made in a
        factory in Mexico. No, I fucking did this, by myself, with my hands! My
        awesome teacher at Penland says you can make a pair of shoes with a
        spoon and knife and a fork. Which is true. And obviously, those aren't
        gonna be really cute shoes, but, you know, it's a super-old tradition.
        Most of my equipment is from the 40s, which you don't need any of to
        make shoes, either, because you can do it with a spoon or knife and
        fork.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> In metalsmithing, there's always
        the next cool tool and the next fun, innovative way to do something. Not
        in boot-making?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Not at all. So there are antique
        tool dealers, and you can buy new tools, but there aren't innovative
        tools. A new sewing machine is going to be nicer, but there have really
        been no improvements to the design of the tools over the last 100 years
        of making custom footwear. And that's people who make shoes. Cowboy boot
        makers do almost all of it by hand.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> What is a place or experience
        you've had since aging out of summer camp that has felt camp-like?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> You know, the moment that got me to
        where I am today is not from camp, but it is from a camp-like
        experience. I was a state officer in 4-H my senior year of high school,
        and I was having a kind of a little retreat weekend with fellow
        officers. And one of my friends, Robert, had started fly-fishing very
        recently, and he brought us a fly rod. And we all tried it out, and that
        moment changed my life, and that's why I'm here today and that's why I
        do what I do today. 1,000% is because of that, that group gathering
        outdoor experience.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Can you pinpoint some specifics
        about that moment, either emotional feet feelings or embodied feelings,
        that maybe was the turning point?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> You know, I think that experience
        is very similar to why I make boots, and it was the combination of
        things that filled my brain. You know, it was the mechanics of trying to
        cast. It's the entomology, it's being outside in a beautiful place. It's
        a combination of those things that really fill my brain. A lot of my
        life I have been longing for a full brain. And I did that through fly
        fishing, and I get that through boot-making. They fill my brain in
        different ways. But, yeah. And I think it's been a lifelong pursuit as
        well. Both of those things.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Entomology?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> The study of bugs.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> Yes. How does that factor in?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> Um, so a lot of fly-fishing is
        knowing about what fish eat and you are trying to match what you're
        seeing on the water. And then that leads you into fly tying, which is an
        art in itself. I am more of a utilitarian fly tyer, but my husband is
        definitely one of the best fly tyers in the country. It is his art, and
        I love watching him combine and add science to his art. It's much more
        elaborate than needed, but that is one of the ways that he's able to
        express himself creatively.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        <span className="speaker">BPF:</span> This is so cool. I completely
        relate to the full brain and how these things are separate. But you
        needed these experiences from different parts of your life in different
        places to get you to figure out what it was that you loved and to make
        it happen in your life, that makes a lot of sense to me. So you have the
        fly-fishing you have the boot-making. We haven't talked yet about your
        academic life as a historian, but I want to loop back to that later. So,
        like, all these things that are different, how do they inform each
        other?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="speaker">MB:</span> You know, I pretty seriously silo
        them. Fly-fishing is what my husband and I do together. That's my family
        time. And boot-making is my art and how I plan to make a living. My
        husband and I were fortunate enough to be able to prioritize our
        interests over pursuing careers. And not having children, we're able to
        live this life because he's a ski mountaineer, and he gardens, and we
        have a half-acre garden. He goes on expeditions where people have never
        been before, or I should say white people have never been before. And so
        I think both of us, maybe having a liberal arts background and creative
        parents, have been able to explore all these pursuits in order to build
        a really unusual life. People get so freakin' confused when I tell them.
        They're, like, oh, what do you do? And I'm, like, oh, it's blah, blah,
        blah. Because it's three houses or three jobs. And I just, you know,
        chose three interesting jobs. Yeah, and that doesn't mean there haven't
        been a lot of uninteresting jobs, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to work for The Nature Conservancy, in development, and, you
        know, I felt like a little bit of a camp counselor there because we
        would put on river trips for donors. And we literally have a tent camp
        that we would set up for donors, for, you know, 70-year-old people to
        have that camp experience. And that's the organization that I work for
        now, and it's just such a privilege to get to live this life. Have fun
        every day at camp. My husband and I went out to dinner last night. And
        we were, like, how the hell did we figure this out? 'Cause it's so
        awesome.
