        Robin Wall Kimmerer is a botanist, educator, writer, and citizen of the
        Potawatomi Nation who advocates for broadening scientific practices by
        incorporating Indigenous knowledge and artistic perspectives into
        research. In the chapter “Asters and Goldenrod,” Kimmerer recounts being
        told by her freshman adviser in forestry school that her idea of science
        was wrong when she expressed that she wanted to be a botanist in order
        to learn why certain flowers looked beautiful together and why some
        plant stems are better for basket weaving than others. To her advisor,
        questions of beauty had no place in science.

        In this chapter Kimmerer describes a common rigidity in academic
        training that she had to acquiesce to while in school. Since then she
        has been able to bring Indigenous knowledge, in which knowing comes from
        an understanding through “all four aspects of our being: mind, body,
        emotion, and spirit,” and creativity back into her scientific practice.
        Her story is a reminder of the resilience needed when making
        epistemological connections that others might not immediately recognize.
        In other words, even though Kimmerer was not encouraged to study the
        beauty of asters and goldenrod while in school, she came to realize that
        her academic science knowledge did not have to be mutually exclusive
        from other ways of knowing. The notion of finding connectivity between
        different disciplines or ways of knowing is a thread that runs through
        this collection of texts in different ways.
