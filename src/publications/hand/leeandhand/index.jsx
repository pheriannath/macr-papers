        Helen Lee is an artist, educator, activist, and parent. During my second
        semester with MACR, while researching a paper on pedagogical shifts in
        glass education, I found I kept returning to Lee’s language and
        identity-heavy practice as the most compelling aspect of my research.
        Encouraged by my advisor for the semester, Anuradha Vikram, I devoted my
        focus toward a deep dive into Lee’s world, crafting both an academic
        paper and a journalistic feature that landed us the Fall 2022 cover of
        Glass Quarterly.

        This next text is a conversation between myself and Lee that uses those
        works as a jumping-off point. In the comments, we talk about the
        experience of writing and being written about, combining the theoretical
        underpinnings provided by Sarah Ahmed and the case-study practicality
        offered by Ruthellen Josselson. The shifts between my ability to
        represent Joyce J. Scott’s practice and Lee’s feel seismic—I developed
        from surface research and self-answering questions to active,
        open-minded listening that drove the direction of the work. And yet—I’m
        still learning. The endnote where Helen tears me a new one for inventing
        a new Chinese alphabet is particularly cringeworthy, <em>and</em>{" "}
        sincerely helpful as a reminder to slow down and fact-check. The process
        of figuring out how to write about another human, regardless of how many
        degrees of separation or difference we share, will never be complete.
        Here I will be vulnerable and share the assumptions I made about Lee’s
        experience and practice, how they were confronted within this piece, and
        how the theoretical underpinnings of MACR allowed for that confrontation
        to be a place of learning rather than one of defensiveness.

        Cicadas have been multiplying rapidly since early spring at Helen Lee’s
        Madison, Wisconsin, studio. This peculiar infestation is part of Lee’s
        work-in-progress entitled <em>Brood</em>, created for a forthcoming
        group exhibition at The Delaware Contemporary art space. The stylized
        cast glass cicadas are designed to visualize the transmission of
        ancestry across time. It is a decadently material piece, relying on
        legions of tests to perfect a jade green color that fades across
        generations of exponential growth. The use of insects as symbols of
        inheritance and legacy is new to Lee’s work, but her underlying themes
        have been consistent since the earliest days of her practice. Lee has
        always emphasized the transformative power of language. She wields this
        instrument to strum the tensions between our universal experiences of
        humanity and mortality.

        Lee heads the esteemed University of Wisconsin-Madison glass program,
        but that is just one of many platforms for her compelling voice. A
        top-tier educator, she is also a leading artist working with glass, as
        well as an advocate and activist
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-b">B</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        —roles richly entangled with and by their interconnecting themes. Lee is
        highly regarded by her students and peers for her technical and
        conceptual rigor as well as her transparent vulnerability. She is also a
        figure unafraid to ask questions and demand answers about equity and
        opportunity in a field that has historically lacked diverse voices. As
        the founder of the nonprofit Glass Education Exchange (GEEX), Lee has
        created
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-c">C</a>

        multiple new avenues for communication and resource-sharing for

        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-d">D</a>
        </sup>
        student populations in the field. Through her 2018 Glass/Cash Survey and
        a fiercely honest and accessible practice of Instagram Story
        editorializing, Lee has confronted the glass world’s financial opacity
        and documented the microaggressions of her experience as a
        Chinese-American woman and working mother. Instead of seeing each of
        these iterations as distinct aspects of Lee’s practice, one need only
        look at the development of her artistic career to see how each facet
        informs and enriches the others.

        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-e">E</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        as a graphic designer and typesetter, Lee enrolled in the Rhode Island
        School of Design’s Glass MFA program. She was drawn to RISD “to explore
        what becoming an artist might mean” for her, gravitating toward glass
        thanks to her experience in a high-school glassblowing program.
        <sup>

        (2006), Lee removed “the primary components of language” in an
        installation-based video work in an attempt to become “closer to the
        profound experience of silence in which my grandmother lived in this
        country.”

        </sup>{" "}
        Platforming the experience of her Chinese-American immigrant grandmother
        through the lens of pop culture allowed Lee to breach a divide,
        translating that othering for her audience while exploring a fascination
        with the miraculous mechanisms of language. It also displayed the
        intimacy of Lee’s relationship with her grandmother, similar to the
        much-later piece <em>Like Clockwork</em> (2015).

        <em>Clockwork</em> uses{" "}

        sentimental poem about Lee’s mother and the loss of her father, a game
        of linguistic peek-a-boo that continued Lee’s methodical investigation
        of language. The verse references “bodies curled up like commas on the
        sheet, punctuating each other’s dreams,” revealing, as Lee puts it, a
        “frustrated writer” using “glass tricks as a coping mechanism for never
        having studied linguistics.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en3">EN3</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Lee notes these early, sentimental works reflected her pushback against
        the usual MFA mandate to avoid work about one’s personal narrative.
        Rejecting that ideal, she states she is

          all of those experiences in some personal codified private space F …
          because everyone that I know that shares any of those traits is

        As if to ensure the clarity of her message, Lee has gone on to spend a
        considerable amount of her studio hours painstakingly crafting murrini
        alphabets and typesets, allowing her to graphically and unambiguously
        transmit any message. Whether speaking directly through artfully crafted
        letters or through more symbolic iterations, Lee provides a model of
        material scholarship that makes space for voicing identity without
        sacrificing complex conceptuality.

        <em>Words Spoken to Me by an Ethiopian Cab Driver</em> (2015) steps past
        Lee’s exploration of her own identity to tell a story of a moment of
        connection across racial lines. Using the format of a gold-plated name
        necklace, Lee memorialized a moment of tender solidarity on a cab ride,
        wherein the cab driver recognized Lee’s immigrant otherness and pushed
        past the surface level exchange of pleasantries to ask, “No, what’s your
        real name?” Lee immediately felt a “rush of affection” for the stranger,
        who shared her experience of having an Americanized name that he used to
        move through the everyday world, as well as an Ethiopian name to which
        he felt a deeper connection. “It was an experience of being seen
        unexpectedly in a way that I so deeply appreciated from him,” she notes.

      <p>
        This sense of solidarity echoes Lee’s recent participation in the
        collaborative work <em>Disclosure</em> (2022), by the artist collective
        Related Tactics. The weeklong workshop invited BIPOC makers in glass to
        “build creative connections and reimagine and unmake the wounds of
        systemic racism in the field.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en6">EN6</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Refreshed and reinvigorated by the camaraderie of the gathering, Lee
        also pointed to her awareness that her experience of moving through the
        world as an Asian American woman is diametrically opposed to the
        experience of being a Black or Latinx male in America.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-h">H</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Throughout the project she labored to maintain a sensitivity to that
        reality in her participation, especially in how she responded to the De
        La Torre brothers’ prompt to make a glass hoodie. Rather than relying on
        moldmaking or sculpting techniques to craft the iconic garment, Lee
        insisted on a framework of blowing into an actual hoodie, dipped in
        plaster, to replicate “skin touching that space, perhaps with an
        identity that we might not actually possess ourselves.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en7">EN7</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        This was, quite possibly, the most complicated way of completing this
        task. Meditating on that decision, Helen recalls asking herself, “What
        the fuck was that? Why did you insist on pulling together all these
        people, all this expertise, all these years of experience to do a
        process that you knew might technically fail? And the answer … was that
        all of us collectively breathed into that space. I think that action was
        the deepest form of empathy that I could manifest in my material
        expertise, to bring all of us together and have us breathe into the
        space of a black hoodie.”

        Lee’s deep well of empathy is on display in the lines of{" "}
        <em>Infinitive</em> (2017), a neon re-creation of a placard found in an
        abandoned Madison foundry. This project started soon after Lee moved to
        Wisconsin and began to acclimatize herself to the culture of her new
        community. “I was really thinking about work ethic … how people here
        came to be the way they were, what work they did that likely shaped so
        much of their values, and what kind of language existed in these spaces
        of labor.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en0">EN9</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        The glowing entreaties to be charitable, to be considerate, and to keep
        trying, as Lee describes in her statement on the piece, “honor the
        universal labor of humanity—from industry to community.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en10">EN10</a>
        </sup>{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        This sentiment recalls Lee’s <em>Glass/Cash Survey</em> from the same
        year—a field-disrupting study she presented to her peers at the 2019
        Robert M. Minkoff Foundation Academic Symposium, at UrbanGlass. Lee
        designed <em>Glass/Cash</em> to give glass artists a “starting point for
        understanding the fiscal implications of a career in glass, including
        the impact of educational debt.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en11">EN11</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Giving artists a foothold to understand the value of their labor honors
        their dignity, speaks to their humanity and acknowledges the universal
        desire to do meaningful work.

          <a href="#annotation-i">I</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Though not Lee’s first foray into activist scholarship in the field, it
        would be among the most provocative.
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-j">J</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        <em>Glass/Cash</em> sparked discussions on labor practices in glass and
        the necessity to course-correct to increase access to a long
        inaccessible material, and was published in the 2019{" "}
        <em>New Glass Now</em> exhibition catalog by the Corning Museum of
        Glass. Notably, Lee credits a casual Instagram story vent about salary
        opacity as the instigating spark for the study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remarkably open to social media’s possibilities as a tool for both
        pedagogy and social change, Lee uses her social media platform as a
        writing practice, what she refers to as her “late night overshares.” In
        recent posts, Lee has praised the accomplishments of her students and
        alumni, documented her own staggering academic workload, confessed to
        the tremendous mom guilt that accompanies that workload, described the
        microaggressions of life as an Asian American woman in Wisconsin, and
        bemoaned the lack of BIPOC representation in popular culture. In these
        missives as well as in <em>Glass/Cash</em> and <em>Infinitive</em>,

        a rolling-marble meditative soundscape that Lee first explored in grad
        school. Lee describes the impetus of the work as re-creating the
        childhood sensory memory of her ear pressed against her father’s chest,
        listening to the pause patterns of his breathing while he spoke. In
        contrast to the familiar concept of white noise, pink noise is a more
        organic sonic frequency—analogous to rainfall, or the sound of crashing
        and receding waves. Though the minimalist <em>Pink Noise</em> contains
        no letters, murrini or otherwise, it is still at its core a love letter
        to language—what Lee describes as a commonplace phenomenon that is in
        fact a miracle. “To be engaged with language is to be engaged with
        breath,” she notes, recalling the wonder of listening to her father fill
        his lungs and use that breath to speak.

        The abstraction of the sheet glass and clear marble construction

        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-m">M</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        while leaving open other interpretations for the audience. The original
        title of the work in grad school, <em>Breathing Underwater</em>,
        indicates pressure—paradoxically, the kind of pressure that Lee faces
        now more than ever given the layered responsibilities of her career, art
        practice, and care responsibilities.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Lee’s 2020 public artwork, <em>Sky Mirrors</em>, offers viewers a brief
        respite from the pressure of life in the age of COVID. An outdoor
        installation for Madison’s Chazen Museum of Art, Lee’s mirrors frame and
        reflect portions of the sky into the visual field of casual passers-by,
        inviting them to pause, breathe, and look up. This work, too, situates
        itself within a framework of language—the original proposal for the work
        involved monitors showing live feeds of clouds-as-sentences, until Lee
        realized that mirrors are, in fact, the original live feed. Instead, the
        rectangular dashes, like unrevealed letters on a{" "}
        <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> board, sample disparate sections of the sky,
        displaying cloud writing
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-n">N</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        for viewers to decode.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus on clouds is also a gentle throwback to Lee’s earlier work,
        <em>Pyrocumulus</em> (2015), a meditation on her Chinese name, which
        roughly translates
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-o">O</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        as “a red cloud before snowfall.” Though thematically similar, the
        florid visual chaos of <em>Pyrocumulus</em> embodies the confusion of
        translating the untranslatable. Serene and minimalist in contrast,
        <em>Sky Mirrors</em> does not attempt to demystify the meaning of the
        clouds for its viewer, but leaves space for individual interpretations
        of the clouds’ expressions. The mirrors are a calming
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-p">P</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        gift to Madison life, installed just as the push to be outdoors during
        the pandemic made public artworks more relevant than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pandemic’s pause effect on the pace of life directly informed the
        making of <em>Wonder</em> (2020), a neon installation which prompts
        viewers to “consider the humanity that has been revealed” by our shared
        trauma. The uncomplicated phrase it spells out is pitch-perfect for a
        moment in time when the national brain is already so overheated from all
        things unprecedented. At the same time, <em>Wonder</em> subtly implores
        the viewer not to waste this unique opportunity to reevaluate
        priorities, whether personal or national. It is fitting that{" "}
        <em>Wonder</em> and GEEX are both pandemic babies—projects born in a
        time of forced change, when glass education quite literally stopped in
        its tracks. GEEX came from a period of enforced downtime while Lee was
        on sabbatical during the early days of the pandemic. With time on her
        hands and a longstanding frustration with the lack of resource-sharing
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-q">Q</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        among glass educators, Lee made the leap to start a nonprofit and begin
        to address the intersecting needs of greater communication, greater pay
        for visiting glass lecturers, and better resources for emerging BIPOC
        artists in glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now entering its third year of programming, GEEX has developed a robust
        schedule of lectures, book clubs, and affinity groups and a writing
        center to accelerate a positive feedback loop of critical thinking and
        writing among self-identified <em>glassies</em>. The added time
        expenditure of running a nonprofit on top of a full academic load,
        active art practice, and parenthood seems insurmountable, but Lee
        describes her work with GEEX as a palate cleanser among the less
        gratifying responsibilities she tackles daily. “I love my team. I love
        that I have two really smart, capable, strong people, and we just sit
        down, think about stuff, and we get shit done. It’s the antidote.”
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-en14">EN14</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        Prominent among the stated goals of GEEX as an organization is a
        commitment to “centering BIPOC voices,” a sentiment that reinforces
        Lee’s recognition of the importance of language, expression, community
        building, and communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between GEEX, Madison, and the myriad other roles and responsibilities
        that fill her days, Lee is a perpetual motion machine of progress for
        the field of glass. Somehow, none of these duties seem to have slowed
        her relentless artistic output. In fact, 2022 has seen a steady ramp-up
        of production in Lee’s studio as <em>Brood</em> reaches critical mass.
        After over 200 color tests to meticulously chart out the perfect shades
        of imitation jade green, she has begun casting, coldworking, and
        fire-polishing the cicada army soon to invade Delaware. The insects are
        stylized to recall origami folded versions of themselves, interpreting
        the Tang dynasty’s funerary tradition of placing a jade cicada on each
        <sup>
          <a href="#annotation-r">R</a>
        </sup>{" "}
        orifice of the dead. While mortality and Chinese identity are well-tread
        themes in her practice, this exhibition will mark new territory for Lee

        As dazzling as the lush materiality of this piece promises to be,
        perhaps the most exciting prospect for this work is its inclusion of
        Lee’s identity as a seasoned mother stepping into her role as
        transmitter of ancestral knowledge to the next generation. As much as
        Lee gives to the young minds making their way into the field of glass,
        to see that power reflected in the eyes of her daughter is the most
        stirring language of all.

        never stopped to think about the distinction and overlap between the

        <strong>Jen:</strong> I guess if I had to drill down to the difference I
        perceive between them, I see your work with <em>Hyperopia</em> and{" "}
        <em>Glass/Cash</em> as advocacy, but somehow starting GEEX feels more
        like activism? Speaking versus acting—does that make sense outside of my
        own brain? To my mind, <em>Critical Vacuum</em> and <em>Glass/Cash</em>{" "}
        were you pointing out problems you saw, and GEEX was you doing something
        about those problems. Though as I say that, I have to stop and
        reconsider my application of the word “activist.” Just the other day, a
        Warren Wilson administrator visiting the MACR program residency referred
        to my practicum (on women in glass) and a colleague’s (on Black craft in
        New York in the 1800s) as “activist scholarship.” It was unsettling.
        Writers who platformed Chihuly and Littleton to the exclusion of others
        were also activists, on the behalf of the “great man” mythology
        surrounding those two. But no one would call writing on white male
        artists “activist scholarship.”

        <strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. This is always a tricky moment for me—I’ll
        spend a bad long while agonizing over which of the political landmines
        to tiptoe over in word choice. “Marginalized “was stricken from my list
        recently because it implies a lack of agency, but putting the
        “systemically” in there points the finger at the system and not the
        subject, and I like that very much.

        speaking all 12 years since I graduated undergrad where my bread and
        butter was graphic design, including freelance gigs that helped put me
        through my time at RISD.

        on you as a glass educator absolutely supplanted the reality of your

        me to read this and then look at my intentional obfuscation of my

        specific form of writing can only come from my fingerprint as a
        maker/thinker/writer. But the distinction here is that the obfuscation
        does not render it private, solely codified.

      <cite>
        <sup id="annotation-h">H</sup> <strong>Helen:</strong> This is
        definitely not how I would phrase this. It falls prey too easily to the
        model minority myth in conglomerating my specific individual
        positionality with that of all Asian American women, and similarly all
        Black/Latinx men. I think the distinction between how I might have
        phrased and how you have phrased is that it’s specifically my own Asian
        American experience I’m speaking to. Or perhaps it’s the “diametric”
        that feels too oversimplified? Something about this feels
        oversimplified.
        <br />
        <strong>Jen:</strong> “Diametric” is absolutely oversimplified. I went
        for the dramatic word rather than the accurate/representative/subtle
        one. That’s a big fucking oops. I did that to try to capture the passion
        in your voice when you spoke about this in our interview—you spoke so
        forcefully about the way our society treats and responds to the Black
        male body. But this absolutely oversimplified that—would have been
        better to use your own words here, I think.

        <sup id="annotation-j">J</sup> <strong>Helen:</strong> I guess this goes
        back to the comment in the other essay re: what constitutes “radical” or
        not. It was modeled after the AIGA salary survey—an industry-wide survey
        that was done every single damn year and was seen as a commonplace
        resource for freelancers. Again, a sort of professionalism that was
        simply status quo in graphic design that the glass community had never
        even heard of before. Thus, provocative? Or just professional?

        because the #1 response I get about my stories is along the lines of, “I
        could/would never be able to speak to XYZ publicly but I get so much out

        <sup id="annotation-m">M</sup> <strong>Helen:</strong> Oh interesting.
        Yes, the work came from an early childhood memory of listening to my
        father’s breathing, but I don’t think of this work as related to my
        family’s deep relationship to grief. I think more of [Ferdinand de]
        Saussure’s tidy graphic of the “model of the speech circuit” and of
        Steven Pinker’s text from The Language Instinct: “In the speech sound
        wave, one word runs into the next seamlessly; there are no little
        silences between spoken words the way there are white spaces between
        written words. We simply hallucinate word boundaries when we reach the
        end of a stretch of sound that matches some entry in our mental
        dictionary.” It’s interesting, though, my father’s death was suicide,
        and the title reads very differently to me in that context.

        hundred-emails-long-threads with hundreds of people just on a cc: and
        folx sending more emails to add more folx to the cc—in a goddamn
