        There is a weight of responsibility that comes with the pleasure of
        writing about the crafts. The joy of investigating a maker’s process,
        the pride in platforming a brilliant process&mdash;these are balanced by
        the imperative to get it right both for the subject and for posterity.
        That weight is further complicated when maker and writer are separated
        by a difference in lived experience, when assumptions and expectations
        intrude upon narrative and connection.

        Decolonizing the craftscape has been one of the primary foci for the MA
        in Critical Craft Studies program since its inception. From the close
        study of texts such as Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s{" "}
        <em>Decolonizing Methodologies</em> to the imperative to center Black
        craft through our interactions with the{" "}

        , MACR scholars are attuned to the necessity of engaging with the
        “other,” defined here as the sphere outside of their own lived
        experience, to achieve the fullest possible understanding of craft and
        its practitioners. One of the manifestations of that focus is in the
        close attention to language, questions, and assumptions when
        representing makers, their histories, and their practices. This was one
        of the primary pillars that drew me to the MACR fold, during a point in
        my career as a glass artist and curator when I was starting to
        accumulate a few scattershot pieces of proto-critical writing in my
        small but endlessly fascinating field. I was aware that my toolkit,
        despite being filled with a love of language and a wonky obsession with
        grammar, was incomplete. I lacked an underpinning of theory and practice
        that could guide my understanding of my subjects and give me greater
        context for the kinds of stories I felt driven to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along my journey to craft a practicum informed and inspired by
        intersectional feminist texts, I deepened my familiarity with the
        foundational works of critical race theory, and discovered writers and
        thinkers who would radically transform my understanding of the systems
        and institutions that make up the sphere of craft and craft studies.
        These encounters forevermore shaped the way I approach writing across
        experience&mdash;keenly aware of my position within the history and my
        responsibility as a conscientious historiographer contributing to the
        archive. From Gloria Anzaldúa’s exploration of intersections of
        identities to the direct action and direct language of the Combahee
        River Collective, the readings and discussions of the MACR program made
        my own assumptions visible and challenged me to push past
        performativity, past the easy answers, and dig deeper into the kind of
        critical work that has the power to make real change in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transformation can be seen in high relief by comparing a pre-MACR
        interview I conducted with artist and legend Joyce J. Scott in late 2020
        and a 2022 profile of artist and activist Helen Lee. In both cases, I
        shared some aspects of identity with my subjects: Woman. Maker. Mother.
        In both cases, we were separated by others: Race. Generation. As an
        interviewer, I grew from a practice of prioritizing my own narrative in
        the result to a focus on radical listening and analysis of a practice
        drawn from deep, thorough research.
      </p>
      <p>
        This journey is and will always be a work in progress, and there is much
        more to be learned from the readings I found in earlier years of the
        MACR archive. Ruthellen Josselson’s On Writing Other People’s Lives
        provides an accessible and approachable introduction to the topic, while
        Stuart Hall’s Minimal Selves investigates the very idea of identity and
        difference. Sarah Ahmed defines and names the dominant culture of
        whiteness that surreptitiously infiltrates every interaction, and makes
        up what in MACR parlance is known as the “soup” that is easy to forget
        we are all swimming in. Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor platforms the wisdom of
        Combahee’s Barbara Smith and reminds the reader that, imperfect or not,
        the work of reaching across difference is worthwhile and worthy.
        Finally, Chelsea Vowel underscores the phenomenal power of both language
        and hope for shaping the world we want to see. Forged together, these
        works form a handhold for those ready to climb out of the silos of their
        own identities and reach a plane of understanding, empathy, and care.
      </p>
      <p>
        These selections are but one way of unpacking identity
        construction&mdash;the way that I personally wound and wove my way
        through the MACR archive to build my toolkit. At the end of my
        introduction to each component of this publication, I offer pickings to
        extend pathways, detours, and redirections to continue the never-ending
        work of understanding ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set the stage for the exploration ahead, I invite you to ponder
        Hall’s assertion that “all identity is constructed across difference.” I
        offer Hall’s words as a struck match, and the selections that follow as
        revelatory fuel for archive dwellers, critical thinkers, and meaning
        makers.
